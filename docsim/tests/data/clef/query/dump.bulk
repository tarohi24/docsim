{"_id": "EP1780094A1", "docid": "EP1780094A1", "title": "Control unit for electric power steering apparatus for automobile", "text": "The present invention relates to an electric power steering apparatus. Embodiments of the present invention relate to an electric power steering apparatus for an automobile. More particularly, embodiments of the present invention relate to an electric power steering apparatus having an electronic control device including a PCB, a metal substrate perpendicular to the PCB, a heating device having a body coupled to the metal substrate, and a radiation plate having a coupling unit on its upper surface, to which the metal substrate is coupled, for improved radiation function. Known power steering apparatuses for automobiles include a hydraulic power steering apparatus utilizing hydraulic pressure of a hydraulic pump, which has been used since its initial introduction, and an electric power steering apparatus utilizing an electric motor, use of which has been gradually universalized since the 1990's. In the existing hydraulic power steering apparatus, a hydraulic pump, which is a power source for supplying steering power, is driven by an engine, which causes the hydraulic pump to continuously consume energy regardless of whether or not the steering wheel is being rotated. In the electric power steering apparatus, when steering torque is generated by rotation of a steering wheel, a motor supplies steering power in proportion to the generated steering torque. Therefore, in energy efficiency terms, the electric power steering apparatus is more advantageous than the hydraulic power steering apparatus. As shown in FIG. 1, a known electric power steering apparatus for an automobile includes a steering system 100, which includes elements from a steering wheel 101 to both wheels 108, and a steering power mechanism 120 for supplying steering power to the steering system 100. The steering system 100 includes a steering shaft 102 having an upper end connected to the steering wheel 101, so that the steering shaft 102 rotates together with the steering wheel 101, and a lower end connected to a pinion shaft 104 via a pair of universal joints 103. The pinion shaft 104 is connected to a rack bar 109 via a rack-pinion mechanism 105. Both ends of the rack bar 109 are connected to the wheels 108 via tie rods 106 and knuckle arms 107. The rack-pinion mechanism 105 includes a pinion gear 111 formed on the lower end of the pinion shaft 104 and a rack gear 112 formed on a side of the outer peripheral surface of the rack bar 109 to engage with the pinion gear 111. The rack-pinion mechanism 105 converts the rotational motion of the pinion shaft 104 into a linear motion of the rack bar 109. Particularly, when the driver operates the steering wheel 101, the pinion shaft 104 rotates accordingly. The rotation of the pinion shaft 104 causes the rack bar 109 to move linearly in the shaft direction. The linear motion of the rack bar 109 is transmitted to and operates the wheels 108 via the tie rods 106 and the knuckle arms 107. The steering power mechanism 120 includes a torque sensor 121 for sensing steering torque applied to the steering wheel 101 by the driver and outputting an electric signal in proportion to the sensed steering torque, a velocity sensor 122 for sensing the velocity of the automobile and outputting an electrical signal, an ECU (electronic control unit) 123 for generating a control signal based on the electric signals from the torque sensor 121 and the velocity sensor 122, and a motor 130 for generating steering power based on the control signal from the ECU 123. The electric power steering apparatus is operated as follows: when the driving wheel 101 is rotated, driving torque is generated and transmitted to the rack bar 109 via the rack-pinion mechanism 105. In addition, the generated steering torque causes the motor 130 to generate steering power, which is transmitted to the rack bar 109. As such, the steering torque generated by the steering system 100 is combined with the steering power generated by the motor 130, so that the rack bar 109 is moved in the shaft direction. As shown in FIG. 2, a known electronic control device includes a PCB 201, a metal substrate 211, and a radiation plate 221. The PCB 201 has various components mounted thereon, including a capacitor 203 for absorbing ripple current included in current supplied to a motor; a shunt resistor 205 for sensing the current supplied to the motor; an FET (field effect transistor) 207 for switching the current supplied to the motor based on the size and direction of steering power; a coil 209 for removing electromagnetic noise; and a microcomputer 210 for calculating steering power based on steering torque and the automobile's velocity. The metal substrate 211 is spaced a predetermined distance from the PCB 201, and a body 208 of the FET 207 is coupled to the upper surface of the metal substrate 211. The radiation plate 221 is positioned on the bottom surface of the metal substrate 211 and is coupled to the PCB 201 and the metal substrate 211 with bolts 213, in order to radiate heat, which is generated from the body 208 of the FET 207 and transmitted via the metal substrate 211, into the air. However, the known electronic control device, constructed as above, has a problem in that it cannot effectively radiate a large quantity of heat, which is generated by the body 208 of the FET 207 when current necessary to drive the motor flows, because the metal substrate 211 and the radiation plate 221 are stacked on each other. Any attempt to increase the thickness of the radiation plate 221, in order to improve heat radiation, is limited by spatial restrictions. When a larger number of FETs 207 are used, their assembly process becomes complicated, because bolts 213 are used to couple respective bodies 208 of the FETs 207 to the metal substrate 211. Accordingly, the present invention has been made in view of the above mentioned problems. Embodiments of the present invention seek to provide an electronic control device having a metal substrate and a radiation plate stacked in such a manner that heat is radiated effectively. Embodiments of the present invention seek to provide an electronic control device having a separate coupling unit on the radiation plate so that the coupling unit can have a large thickness, regardless of spatial restrictions, and heat can be radiated effectively. Still other embodiments of the present invention seek to provide an electronic control device having a heating device (e.g. FET), the body of which is soldered to the metal substrate without using bolts, and a radiation plate having a coupling unit adapted in such a manner that the metal substrate, which has the body of the heating device coupled thereto, can be coupled to the coupling unit using bolts for simplification of the assembly process. According to embodiments of the present invention, there is provided an electronic control device for an electric power steering apparatus having an electronic control device for controlling motor current based on electric signals inputted from a torque sensor of an automobile and a motor for generating steering power, the electronic control device including a PCB; a metal substrate formed on a lower side of the PCB in a plate shape while being perpendicular to the PCB; a heating device having a terminal coupled to the PCB and a body coupled to a front surface of the metal substrate; and a radiation plate spaced a predetermined distance from the PCB and having a coupling unit formed on an upper surface of the radiation plate, the metal substrate being coupled to the coupling unit. According to alternative embodiments of the present invention, there is provided an electric power steering apparatus for an automobile including a pinion shaft connected to a steering wheel of the automobile and having a pinion gear formed on a side thereof; a rack bar connected to both wheels of the automobile and having a rack gear formed on a side thereof to engage with the pinion gear; a torque sensor for sensing steering torque applied to the steering wheel and outputting an electric signal; a velocity sensor for sensing velocity of the automobile and outputting an electric signal; an electronic control device for generating a control signal based on the electrical signals from the toque sensor and the velocity sensor; and a motor for generating steering power based on the control signal from the electronic control device, the electronic control device including a PCB; a metal substrate formed on a lower side of the PCB in a plate shape while being perpendicular to the PCB; a heating device having a terminal coupled to the PCB and a body coupled to a front surface of the metal substrate; and a radiation plate spaced a predetermined distance from the PCB and having a coupling unit formed on an upper surface of the radiation plate, the metal substrate being coupled to the coupling unit. In the following description and drawings, like reference signs indicate like parts. Embodiments of the invention will now be described by way of non-limiting example only, with reference to the drawings, in which: FIG. 1 shows the construction of a known electric power steering apparatus for an automobile; FIG. 2 is an exploded perspective view briefly showing a known electronic control device; FIG. 3a is an exploded perspective view briefly showing an electronic control device embodying the present invention; FIG. 3b shows a circuit diagram of an electronic control device embodying the present invention; FIG. 4 is a sectional view showing a process for soldering a heating device to a metal substrate; FIG. 5 is a lateral sectional view showing a process for mounting a substrate case on a radiation plate; and FIG. 6 is a partially-broken perspective view showing a coupling unit formed on a radiation plate. Hereinafter, an embodiment of the present invention will be described with reference to the accompanying drawings. In the following description and drawings, the same reference numerals are used to designate the same or similar components, and so repetition of the description on the same or similar components will be omitted. As shown in FIGs. 3a and 3b, the electronic control device according to an embodiment of the present invention includes a PCB 201; a plate-shaped metal substrate 211 positioned on top of the PCB 201 while being perpendicular to the PCB 201; a heating device 303 having a terminal 301 coupled to the PCB 301 and a body 208 coupled to the front surface of the metal substrate 211; and a radiation plate 221 spaced a predetermined distance from the PCB 201 and having a coupling unit 305, to which the metal substrate 211 is coupled, positioned on the bottom surface thereof. The PCB 201 has a wiring pattern formed on a surface thereof so that a microcomputer 210, a capacitor 203, a shunt resistor 205, and a coil 209 are mounted on the PCB 201 via their terminals, which are soldered to the wiring pattern, respectively. The PCB 201 has a connector 311 mounted on a side thereof, in order to connect a motor 130 and a battery 335, which supplies motor current IM for driving the motor 130, to a bridge circuit 337. The bridge circuit 337 is composed of a plurality of switching devices to switch the motor current IM based on the size and direction of steering power. The microcomputer 210 calculates steering power, based on steering torque and the automobile's velocity, and generates a control signal, based on the calculated steering power. The microcomputer 210 includes a motor current determination unit 331 for generating commands regarding rotational direction of the motor 130 and motor current (IM), based on the steering power, and a PID control unit 333. Upon receiving a current control signal from the microcomputer 210, a drive circuit 341 drives the motor 130 using the bridge circuit 337. The capacitor 203 is adapted to absorb a ripple current component included in the motor current IM and has an electrostatic capacity of about 3600\u00b5F. The shunt resistor 205 has a motor current sensing unit 339 positioned on an end thereof to sense the motor current IM. Meanwhile, the shunt resistor 205 has a problem in that it generates excessive heat. In order to avoid this problem, an inexpensive current sensor (not shown) may be positioned between the bridge circuit 337 and the connector 311, as shown in FIG. 3b, to replace the shunt resistor 205. The PCB 201 has coupling holes 313 formed on corners thereof so that the PCB 201 can be coupled to posts 315 of the radiation plate 221 by bolts 213, as will be described later. The PCB 201 may have pin coupling holes 323 spaced a predetermined distance from the coupling holes 313 so that coupling pins 321 of the posts 315 can be inserted therein, as will be described later. The heating device 303 includes a terminal 301 and a body 208. The heating device 303 may be any type of electronic device, including an FET, which consumes much power. The terminal 301 connects the heating device 303 to the PCB 201 and supplies the body 208 with current. When the heating device 303 is to be mounted on the PCB 201, the terminal 301 is positioned so as to extend through the PCB 201 from a surface of the PCB 201 and an end of the terminal 301, which protrudes from the other surface of the PCB 201, is soldered to fix the terminal 301 to the PCB 201. The body 208 is adapted to perform a predetermined function when the heating device 303 is supplied with current. The body 208 is coupled to the metal substrate 211 to radiate heat occurring during operation, as will be described later. As shown in FIG. 4, the body 208 is coupled to the metal substrate 211 by forming coupling holes on a side of the body 208, forming bolt holes on the metal substrate, and coupling the body 208 to the metal substrate 211 using bolts. According to embodiments of the present invention, and as shown in FIG. 4, the body 208 is coupled to the metal substrate 211 by positioning a metal plate 304 on a side of the body 208, applying solder 306 to the front surface of the metal substrate 211, and soldering the metal plate 304 to the metal substrate 211. Embodiments of the present invention provide a shorter and simpler assembly process. More particularly, in known apparatuses, each heating device 303 is fixed to the metal substrate 211 using bolts one by one and, when a large number of heating devices 303 are used, the assembly process is inevitably complicated and prolonged. In contrast, in an apparatus according to embodiments of the present invention, the heating device 303 is simply soldered to the metal substrate 211. The metal substrate 211 transmits heat from the heating device 303 to the radiation plate 221. The metal substrate 211 has the shape of a plate and is positioned on top of the PCB 201 while being perpendicular to the PCB 201. The body 208 of the heating device 303 is coupled to the front surface of the metal substrate 211. The metal substrate 211 may be made of metal having good thermal conductivity, such as aluminum or copper, so that heat can be rapidly transmitted from the heating device 303 to the radiation plate 221. The metal substrate 211 has coupling holes 313 formed on corners thereof, through which bolts 213 extend, and the radiation plate 221 has bolt holes 317 formed on its coupling unit 305, as will be described later, so that the metal substrate 211 can be coupled to the front surface of the coupling unit 305 with the bolts 213. The radiation plate 221 is adapted to radiate heat, which is transmitted via the metal substrate 211, into the air quickly. The radiation plate 221 has a coupling unit 305 and posts 315 positioned on its bottom surface and is spaced a predetermined distance from the PCB 201. The radiation plate 221 may be made of metal having good thermal conductivity, such as aluminum or copper, so that heat can be radiated from the heating device 303 into the air quickly. As shown in FIG. 5, a substrate case 501, which is adapted to enclose the PCB 201 from above, is coupled to a coupling step 503, which protrudes from the bottom of the radiation plate 221 in the lateral direction, using bolts 231 so that various devices mounted on the PCB 201 are protected. Alternatively, the bolts 213 may be coupled to the radiation plate 221 in the lateral direction without using the coupling step 503. The coupling unit 305 protrudes from a side of the bottom surface of the radiation plate 221 and has bolt holes 317 formed on the front surface thereof so that the metal substrate 211 can be coupled to the front surface of the coupling unit 305 with bolts 213. The coupling unit 305 may have a mounting groove 325 formed on the front surface thereof in a shape corresponding to that of the metal substrate 211 so that the metal substrate 211 can be fastened to the coupling unit 305 by seating the metal substrate 211 in the mounting groove 325. The coupling unit 305 acts as a path along which heat is transmitted from the heating device 303 to the radiation plate 221. Therefore, the coupling unit 305 must quickly radiate generated heat, as well as quickly transmit the heat to other parts of the radiation plate 221. As shown in FIG. 6, the coupling unit 305 may have protrusions 601 formed on the rear or bottom surface thereof, in order to increase the surface area of the coupling unit 305, which is in contact with air, and improve heat radiation effect. Alternatively, the coupling unit 305 may have a radiation groove 319 formed on the bottom surface thereof with a predetermined depth, in order to improve heat radiation effect. According to known apparatuses, an increase in the thickness of the radiation plate 221 for better heat radiation is limited by spatial restrictions. In contrast, according to embodiments of the present invention, the thickness W of the radiation plate 221 can be increased as desired by increasing the width W of the coupling unit 305 to the same degree. As a result, the heat radiation effect can be improved without any spatial restrictions. The posts 315 protrude a predetermined length from corners of the bottom surface of the radiation plate 221 and have bolt holes 317 formed on the inner portion thereof so that the PCB 201, which is provided with coupling holes 313, can be fixed to the posts 315 with bolts 213. The radiation plate 221 is usually square and may have four posts 315, but the number is not limited to that herein. The posts 315 may have coupling pins 321 formed on the top thereof with a predetermined length to be inserted into the pin coupling holes 323 formed on the PCB 201. This is advantageous in that, when the PCB 201 and the radiation plate 221 are to be coupled to each other, they can be fixed to each other before using bolts 213. In addition, the coupling holes 313 of the PCB 201 and the bolt holes 317 of the posts 315 are automatically aligned with each other so that bolts 213 can be coupled thereto more easily. Furthermore, coupling between the coupling pins 321 and the pin coupling holes 323 enhances the coupling between the PCB 201 and the posts 315. As mentioned above, the electronic control device according to embodiments of the present invention is advantageous in that the metal substrate and radiation plate are stacked in such a manner that heat can be effectively radiated from the heating device. In addition, the width of the coupling unit can be increased as desired, without any spatial restrictions, to improve heat radiation effect. Furthermore, the body of the heating device is soldered to the metal substrate, which is then fixed to the coupling unit of the radiation plate with bolts. This simplifies the assembly process. The invention has now been described with reference to an example. The invention itself however is not restricted to the described features but is only limited by the following claims.", "tags": ["B62D"]}
{"_id": "EP1457985A1", "docid": "EP1457985A1", "title": "DATA RECORD MEDIUM, DATA RECORDING METHOD AND APPARATUS, AND DATA REPRODUCING METHOD AND APPARATUS", "text": "Technical Field The present invention relates to a data recording medium on which encrypted content data is recorded, a recording method and apparatus for recording data on such a data recording medium, and a data reproducing method and apparatus for reproducing data from such a data recording medium. Background Art Since optical discs such as CDs (Compact Discs) and CD-ROMs (Compact Disc Read Only Memories) are easy to handle and their production costs are relatively low, as recording mediums for storing data, they have been widely used. In recent years, CD-R (Compact Disc Recordable) discs, which are data write-once type discs, and CD-RW (Compact Disc Rewritable) discs, which are data rewritable type discs, have come out. Thus, data can be easily recorded on such optical discs. Optical discs such as CD-DA (Compact Disc Digital Audio) discs, CD-ROM discs, CD-R discs, and CD-RW discs based on the CD standard have become the mainstream of data recording mediums. In recent years, moreover, content data such as audio data compressed according to MP3 (MPEG 1 Audio Layer-3) and ATRAC (Adaptive TRansform Acoustic Coding) 3 have been recorded on CD-R discs, CD-RW discs, and so forth. However, since CD-R discs and CD-RW discs have come out, data recorded on optical discs such as CD-DA discs and CD-ROM discs can be easily copied. Thus, data recorded on discs has been copied to other discs and illegally used. As a result, a problem of copyright protection has arisen. Thus, it is necessary to take countermeasures for copyright protection of content data. As one method for protecting content data recorded on such an optical disc, the content data recorded on the disc is encrypted. When content data recorded on a disc has been encrypted, unless key data with which the content data is decrypted is obtained, the content data cannot be decrypted. Thus, the content data can be protected. A system that uses DRM (Digital Rights Management) data as information about copyright protection of content data to restrict reproducing operation and copy operation of the content data may be considered. However, when content data is encrypted to protect copyright of content data, the recording position of key data thereof should be considered. To strongly protect content data, it is preferred to record the key data at a position that a conventional player and a conventional drive cannot easily access. As such a position that the conventional player the conventional drive cannot easily access, there would be for example a lead-in area, a lead-out area, or the like of a disc. However, when key data with which content data is decrypted is recorded at a position such as a lead-in area, a lead-out area, or the like that cannot be easily accessed, the content data cannot be reproduced unless a new type player or a new type drive that can deal with it is used. Players and drives that can record and reproduce data to/from CD-DA discs, CD-ROM discs, CD-R discs, and CD-RW discs have been widely used. Thus, in consideration of compatibility with the conventional players and drives, the key data cannot be recorded at a position that they cannot easily access. Thus, the key data has to be recorded at a position such as a program area of a disc that they can relatively easily access. However, when the key data is recoded in the program area, there will be a risk of which content data cannot be sufficiently protected. In particular, some of conventional CD-R drives and CD-RW drives have a disc copy function. Those drives can copy all data of one disc to another disc. With such a function, there is a possibility of which key data recorded in the program area is copied as it is. Therefore, an object of the present invention is to provide a data recording medium, a data recording method and apparatus, and a data reproducing method and apparatus that prevent a disc from being copied so as to protect copyright of contents. Disclosure of the Invention The present invention is a recording medium on which at least one piece of data that has been encoded with a first error correction code and at least data that can be decoded with the first error correction code and that can be decoded with a second error correction code that is different from the first error correction code are recorded. The present invention is a recording medium on which at least data that has been encoded with a first error correction code, data that has been encoded with a second error correction code, and data that can be decoded with the first error correction code and that can be decoded with the second error correction code are recorded. The present invention is a recording method for a recording medium, comprising the steps of recording at least one piece of data that has been encoded with a first error correction code; and recording at least data that can be decoded with a second error correction code that is different from the first error correction code. The present invention is a recording apparatus for a recording medium, comprising: an encoding process portion for performing an encoding process including an error correction code encoding process for input data with a first error correction code; a recording portion for receiving output data of the encoding process portion and recording the received data on the recording medium; and a generating portion for generating data that can be decoded with the first error correction code and that can be decoded with a second error correction code that is different from the first error correction code. The present invention is a reproducing apparatus for a recording medium, comprising a head portion for reading data from the recording medium on which at least one piece of data that has been encoded with a first error correction code and data that can be decoded with the first error correction code and a second error correction code that is different from the second error correction code have been recorded; a decoding process portion for performing a decoding process including an error correction code decoding process for an output signal of the head portion with the first error correction code; and a controlling portion for performing a control with the output data of the decoding process portion corresponding to the data that can be decoded. The present invention is a reproducing method for a recording medium, comprising the steps of reading data from the recording medium on which at least one piece of data that has been encoded with a first error correction code and data that can be decoded with the first error correction code and a second error correction code that is different from the second error correction code have been recorded and performing a decoding process including an error correction code decoding process for the read data with the first error correction code; and performing a control with the output data of which the decoding process has been performed corresponding to the data that can be decoded.

Best Modes for Carrying out the Invention Next, with reference to the accompanying drawings, an embodiment of the present invention will be described. According to the embodiment, as a recording medium, a new type optical disc is used. An optical disc according to the present invention is almost the same as a CD disc in physical standards such as size. Information recorded on the optical disc according to the present invention can be optically read by a conventional disc drive. Encrypted content data is recorded on the optical disc according to the present invention. The encrypted content data is for example CD-ROM format and CD-DA format audio data and picture data that have been encrypted. As an example of the encrypting method, DES (Data Encryption Standard) can be used. When necessary, content data is compression-encoded according to ATRAC3 (Adaptive TRansform Acoustic Coding 3), MP 3 (MPEG Audio Layer-3), AAC (MPEG 2 Advanced Audio Coding), TwinVQ, or the like. Fig. 1 and Fig. 2 show the structure of the optical disc according to the present invention. The diameter of the optical disc 1 according to the present invention is 120 mm. A hole 2 is formed at the center of the optical disc 1. There is another optical disc 1 having a diameter of 80 mm, which is referred to as CD single. In addition, there are three types of optical discs 1 categorized as a reproduction only type optical disc, a write once type optical disc, and a re-recordable type optical disc. In the reproduction only type optical disc 1, a recording layer is made of aluminum. In the reproduction only type optical disc 1, data is recorded as physical pits. Normally, such a disc is produced by a stamper. A recording layer as a reflecting layer made of aluminum is coated on the substrate. In the write once type optical disc 1, a recording layer is made of an organic coloring matter such as phthalocyanine or cyanine. In the write once type optical disc, when data is written, the temperature of the recording layer made of an organic coloring matter on the disc is raised by a laser beam. As a result, the recording layer made of the coloring matter is thermally deformed. In the re-recordable type optical disc 1, a recording layer is made of a phase change material. The phase change material is for example an alloy of Ag - In - Sb - Te (silver - indium - antimony - tellurium) is used. Such a phase change material has a crystal phase and an amorphous phase. When the intensity of the laser beam is strong, namely the power of the laser beam is strong, the temperature of the recording layer made of the phase change material is raised over the melting point and then the material is quickly cooled. As a result, the phase change recording layer becomes an amorphous state. When the intensity of the laser beam is relatively low, namely the power of the laser beam is weak, the recording layer made of the phase change material is raised to around the crystallization temperature and then gradually cooled. As a result, the recording layer becomes a crystal state. When the recording layer is irreversibly changed between the crystal phase and the amorphous phase, data can be rewritten. As shown in Fig. 2, a first lead-in area LI1 is formed on the innermost periphery of the optical disc. On an outer periphery of the lead-in area LI1, a first program area PA1 is formed. On an outer periphery of the first program area PA1, a first lead-out area LO1 is formed. In the first program area PA1, audio data is recorded in the same recording format as data in the CD-DA format. The audio data in the first program area PA1 has the same recording format as data in the CD-DA format. In addition, since the audio data has not been encrypted, it can be reproduced by a conventional music reproducing player, namely a CD player that has a reproducing function for a CD-DA disc. Outside the first lead-out area LO1, a second lead-in area LI2 is formed. On an outer periphery of the lead-in area LI2, a second program area PA2 is formed. Outside the second program area PA2, a second lead-out area is formed. In the second program area PA2, audio data that has been compressed according to for example ATRAC3 encoding system is encrypted and recorded as content data. In addition, the second program area PA2 is divided into an area AR1 and an area AR2. In the area AR1, data has been encoded with an error correction code according to the CIRC4 system. In the area AR2, data has been encoded with an error correction code according to the CIRC7 system. In the area AR1, audio data that has been compressed according to for example the ATRAC3 system is encrypted and recorded as content data. In addition, in the area AR1, key locker data K_LOCK and data of a software player SFT1 are recorded. Key locker data is a plurality of pieces of content key data that have been encoded and encrypted. A plurality of pieces of content key data can be taken for a locker that stores a plurality of pieces of content key data in the real world. Thus, it is called so. In other words, in the real world, keys of individual rooms are stored in one locker. The locker is locked with a key. An operation for encoding and encrypting content keys with which a plurality of contents recorded on an optical disc are decrypted is analogous to an operation for storing keys of individual rooms in a locker in the real world. Thus, the operation for encoding and encrypting a plurality of pieces of content key data is called key locker data. In addition, the key locker data may contain copyright management information with which copyright of content data is managed (for example, restrictions of reproducing operation and copy operation for content data). Data of the software player SFT1 is program data for causing software to decrypt content data. Somewhere in the area AR2, at least part of key data with which content data recorded in the area AR1 of the second program area PA2 is recoded as hidden key data KH. The hidden key data KH is recorded in such a manner that it can be decoded according to any one of the CIRC4 system and the CIRC7 system. In other words, as will be described later, the CIRC4 system and the CIRC7 system perform an error correction code encoding process based on the CIRC (Cross Interleave Reed-Solomon Code) system used in a conventional CD. The CIRC4 system is different from the CIRC7 system in the interleave length. In this example, an error correction code encoding system used in conventional CD-R disc, CD-R disc, and CD-RW disc drives is referred to as CIRC4 system. In contrast, an error correction code encoding system that will be used in double-density CDs is referred to as CIRC7 system. An error correction code decoding apparatus according to the CIRC4 system cannot decode data that has been encoded with an error correction code according to the CIRC7 system. Thus, data in the area AR2 that has been encoded with the error correction code according to the CIRC7 system cannot be decrypted by a conventional player and a conventional drive. However, data in a special matrix can be decoded according to any one of the CIRC4 system and the CIRC7 system. As will be described later, as the special relation, predetermined data is repeated as one unit in the vertical direction when data is two-dimensionally arrayed. The above-mentioned hidden key data KH is data of which predetermined data is repeated as one unit in the vertical direction. The hidden key data KH is encoded with the error correction code according to the CIRC7 system and recorded in the area AR2. In the optical disc 1 shown in Fig. 1 and Fig. 2, when the conventional player and drive that have only an error correction code decoding circuit according to the CIRC4 system decodes content data recorded in the second program area PA2, the application of the software player SFT1 gets started. The data of the software player SFT1 contains the recording position of the hidden key data KH in the area AR2. With the hidden key data KH, data of the key locker data K_LOCK is decrypted. When the application of the software player SFT1 gets started, the recording position of the hidden key data KH is designated. The hidden key data KH is recorded in the area AR2 in such a manner that the hidden key data KH can be decoded according to any one of the CIRC4 system and the CIRC7 system. Thus, when the recording position of the hidden key data KH is obtained, the conventional player and driver, which have only the error correction code decoding circuit, can take the hidden key data KH out of the area AR2. When the software player SFT1 designates the recording position of the hidden key data KH in the area AR2, the software player SFT1 accesses the position and reads the hidden key data KH from the area AR2. With the hidden key data KH, key locker data key KL is generated. With the key locker data key KL, key locker data is decrypted. With the key locker data key KL, data of the locker K_LOCK is obtained. Content key data KC with which content data is decrypted is taken out of the key locker data K_LOCK. With the content key data KC, the content data is decrypted. In the forgoing example, the content key KC with which content data is decrypted is stored in the key locker data K_LOCK. Part of a key with which the key locker data key KL is generated is recorded as the hidden key data KH in the area AR2. In other words, since content data is multiply locked, the security thereof is improved and the management thereof becomes simple. Of course, the content key data KC may be recorded in the area AR2 in which content data is encoded with the error correction code according to the CIRC7 system in such a manner that the content key data KC can be decoded according to any one of the CIRC4 system and the CIRC7 system. The key locker data key KL may be recorded in the area AR2 in which content data is encoded with the error correction code according to the CIRC7 system in such a manner that the key locker data key KL can be decoded according to any one of the CIRC4 system and the CIRC7 system. Although there are many encrypting systems, at least part of key data with which content data is decrypted is recorded in the area AR2 in which content data is encoded with the error correction code according tot the CIRC7 system in such a manner that the key data is decoded according to any one of the CIRC4 system and the CIRC7 system. Data that represents the recording position is provided. In the optical disc 1 according to the present invention, the second program area PA2 is divided into two areas AR1 and AR2 in which content data is encoded according to different error correction code encoding systems. In the area AR2, at least part of key data with which content data is decrypted is recorded in such a manner that the content data can be decoded according to any one of the CIRC7 system and the CIRC4 system. In the optical disc 1, even if it is known that the hidden key data KH, which is at least part of the key data with which content data is decrypted, is recorded in the area AR2, the hidden key data KH is recorded in the area AR2 in which content data is encoded with the error correction code according to the CIRC7 system. Thus, when the conventional player and drive read data from the area AR2, an error that cannot be corrected takes place. Thus, the hidden key data KH cannot be easily found out. In the area AR2, content data has been encoded with the error correction code according to the CIRC7 system. Thus, even if whole data recorded on the disc is copied, data in the area AR2 is not copied as it is. Thus, the hidden key data KH is protected. As a result, security against whole disc copy (hereinafter simply referred to as disc copy) is improved. Fig. 3 shows an outline of a process for disc-copying data from an original optical disc 1A to a destination optical disc 1B. In Fig. 3, as was described above, in the area AR2 of the original optical disc 1A, data that has been encoded with the error correction code according to the CIRC7 system is recorded. The data contains the hidden key data KH in such a manner that the hidden key data KH can be decoded according to any one of the CIRC4 system and the CIRC7 system. In a reproducing apparatus 31, the original optical disc 1A is loaded. Data is read from the original optical disc 1A. The data that has been read from the original optical disc 1A is supplied to an error correcting circuit 33. The error correcting circuit 33 performs an error correcting process for the data that has been read from the original optical disc 1A according to the CIRC4 system. As shown in Fig. 4A, in the area AR2 of the original optical disc 1A, data that has been encoded with the error correction code according to the CIRC7 system is recoded. The data contains the hidden key data KH in such a manner that the hidden key data KH can be decoded according to any one of the CIRC4 system and the CIRC7 system. In that case, most of data in the area AR2 except for a portion that can be decoded according to any one of the CIRC4 system and the CIRC7 system results in an error that cannot be corrected. When most of data results in an error that cannot be corrected, some apparatuses stop due to a presence of abnormality. When an apparatus stops due to a presence of abnormality, the apparatus cannot disc-copy data. When data is reproduced, if an error that cannot be corrected takes place, interpolated data is substituted for the error. Now, assuming that interpolated data is substituted for an error that cannot be corrected, when data is output from the reproducing apparatus 31, as shown in Fig. 4B, interpolated data is substituted for data in the area AR2. As a result, the hidden key data KH disappears. Now, it is assumed that the reproducing apparatus 31 performs such an interpolating process and output data of the reproducing apparatus 31 is sent to a recording apparatus 32. The destination optical disc 1B is loaded to the recording apparatus 32. The data that has been input to the recording apparatus 32 is supplied to an error correction code encoding circuit 34 according to the CIRC4 system. The error correction code encoding circuit 34 performs an error correction code encoding process for the input data according to the CIRC4 system. The data that has been encoded with the error correction code according to the CIRC4 system is recorded on the optical disc 1B. Thus, on the copied optical disc 1B, data that has been encoded with the error correction code according to the CIRC4 system is recorded. Thus, as shown in Fig. 4C, the hidden key data KH in the area AR2 completely disappears. An error correction code is normally added so as to detect a burst error and random error and perform a correcting process. However, in the optical disc 1 according to the present invention, at least part of key data with which content data is decoded according to any one of the CIRC7 system and the CIRC4 system is recorded in the area AR2 in which data is encoded with the error correction code according to the CIRC7 system so as to improve the security. Next, the error correction code according to the CRIC4 system and the error correction code according to the CIRC7 system will be described. In CDs, as an error correction code encoding system, a CIRC of which an error correction code encoding process is dually performed for a C1 sequence (in the vertical direction) and a C2 sequence (in the diagonal direction) is used. Data that has been encoded with the error correction code is EFM-modulated in the unit of one frame and recorded. Fig. 5 shows one frame of a CD data structure that has not been EFM modulated. As shown in Fig. 5, when audio data is sampled with 16 bits, one frame is composed of 24 symbols of data bits, four symbols of a Q parity, four symbols of a P parity, and one symbol of a sub code. 24 symbols of data bits are composed of six samples on the left (L) and six samples on the right (R). One symbol is made of eight bits of which 16 bits are divided by two. Data of one frame recorded on the disc is converted from eight bits into 14 bits by the EFM modulation. In addition, a direct current component suppression bit and a frame sync are added to data of one frame. Thus, one frame recorded on the disc is composed of: Frame sync 24 channel bits Data bits 14 x 24 = 336 channel bits Sub code 14 channel bits Parity 14 x 8 = 112 channel bits Margin bits 3 x 34 = 102 channel bits Thus, the total number of channel bits of one frame is 588 channel bits. One symbol of a sub code of each frame contains bits of eight channels P to W. As shown in Fig. 6, one sector is composed of data in the period (98 frames) for sub code. The first two frames of 98 frames are sub code frame syncs S0 and S1. When data is recorded on an optical disc such as a CD-ROM, one sector is composed of 98 frames (2,352 bytes), which is a sub code completion unit. Fig. 7 and Fig. 8 are block diagrams showing a flow of an encoding process according to the CIRC system. For simplicity, the encoding process/decoding process according to the CIRC system will be described for audio data. 24 symbols (W12n,A, W12n,B, ..., W12n+11,A, W12n+11,B) of which one word of an audio signal is divided into high order eight bits and low order eight bits) (high order eight bits are denoted by A and lower eight bits by B) are supplied to a two-symbol delaying/scrambling circuit 11. The two-symbol delaying/scrambling circuit 11 delays each of the even word data L6n, R6n, L6n+2, R6n+2, ... by two symbols. Even if all the corresponding sequence has an error in a C2 encoder 12, the two-symbol delaying/scrambling circuit 11 interpolates it. The two-symbol delaying/scrambling circuit 11 scrambles the 24 symbols so that the maximum burst error interpolation length can be obtained. Outputs of the two-symbol delaying/scrambling circuit 11 are supplied to the C2 encoder 12. The C2 encoder 12 encodes (28, 24, 5) Reed-Solomon code on the Galois field GF (28) and generates four-symbol Q parities Q12n, Q12+1, Q12n+2, and Q12n+3. 28 symbols that are output from the C2 encoder 12 are supplied to an interleaving circuit 13. The interleaving circuit 13 assigns delay amounts that vary in arithmetic progression such as 0, D, 2D, ..., (where D represents a unit delay amount) to each symbol so as to change one array of a symbol to a second array. Outputs of the interleaving circuit 13 are supplied to a C1 encoder 14 that uses (32, 28, 5) Reed-Solomon code on the Galois field (GF 28) as a C1 code. The C1 encoder 14 generates four-symbol P parities P12n, P12n+1, P12n+2, and P12n+3. The minimum distance of each of the C1 code and C2 code is 5. Thus, the C1 encoder 14 can correct a two-symbol error and erasure-correct a four-symbol error (in the case that the position of an error symbol is known). 32 symbols that are output from the C1 encoder 14 are supplied to a one-symbol delaying circuit 15. The one-symbol delaying circuit 15 separates adjacent symbols so as to prevent an error that spreads over a boundary of one symbol from resulting in a two-symbol error. The Q parity is inverted by an inverter. Thus, even if all data and parities become zero, an error can be detected. The unit delay amount D of the interleaving circuit 13 according to the CIRC4 system is different from that according to the CIRC7 system. The interleaving circuit 13 disperses a burst error. In other words, according to the CIRC4 system, the interleaving circuit 13 designates D = 4 frames and separates adjacent symbols by four frames each. The CIRC4 system of D = 4 frames is used in the current CD-DA. According to the CIRC4 system, the maximum delay amount becomes 27D (= 108 frames). The total interleave length becomes 109 frames. According to the CIRC7 system, the interleaving circuit 13 designates D = 7 frames and separates adjacent symbols by seven frames each. The CIRC7 system of D = 7 frames has been proposed for a double density CD. According to the CIRC7 system, the maximum delay amount becomes 27D (= 189 frames). The total interleave length becomes 190 frames. Fig. 9 and Fig. 10 are block diagrams showing a flow of the decoding process. The decoding process is performed in the reverse order of the forgoing encoding process. Reproduction data that is output from the EFM demodulating circuit is supplied to a one-symbol delaying circuit 21. The delay assigned by the one-symbol delaying circuit 15 on the encoding side is cancelled by the one-symbol delaying circuit 21. 32 symbols that are output from the one-symbol delaying circuit 21 are supplied to a C1 decoder 22. Outputs of the C1 decoder 22 are supplied to a de-interleaving circuit 23. The de-interleaving circuit 23 assigns delay amounts 27D, 26D, ..., D, and 0 that vary in arithmetic progression to the 28 symbols so that the delay amounts assigned by the interleaving circuit 13 are cancelled. According to the CIRC4 system, the unit delay amount of the de-interleaving circuit 23 is D = 4 frames. According to the CIRC7 system, the unit delay amount of the de-interleaving circuit 23 is D = 7 frames. Outputs of the de-interleaving circuit 23 are supplied to a C2 decoder 24. The C2 decoder 24 decodes the outputs of the de-interleaving circuit 23 with the C2 code. 24 symbols that are output from the C2 decoder 24 are supplied to a two-symbol delaying/descrambling circuit 25. 24 symbols of decoded data are obtained from the two-symbol delaying/descrambling circuit 25. With error flags that are output from the C1 decoder 22 and the C2 decoder 24, an interpolation flag generating circuit 26 generates an interpolation flag. With the interpolation flag, data that represents an error is interpolated. In such a manner, according to the CIRC, the error correction code encoding process is performed with the C1 sequence in the vertical direction. In addition, the error correction code encoding process is performed with the C2 sequence in the diagonal direction. Thus, the error correction code encoding process is dually performed. The CIRC4 system and the CIRC7 system differ in their interleave lengths. According to the CIRC4 system, as shown in Fig. 11, the unit delay amount D is (D = 4). The total interleave length is 109 (= 108 + 1) frames. Thus, according to the CIRC4 system, the total interleave length is slightly larger than the data length of one block. According to the CIRC7 system, as shown in Fig. 11, the unit delay amount D is (D = 7). The total interleave length is 190 (= 189 + 1) frames. Thus, according to the CIRC7 system, the total interleave length is slightly shorter than the data length of two blocks. The total interleave length defines the correction performance against a burst error of which much data successively fails due to a fingerprint left on the disc, a scratch thereon, and so forth. The total interleave length is proportional to the correction performance for a burst error. In the double density CD, an improvement of correction performance against a burst error has been desired. Thus, in the double density CD, an error correction code according to the CIRC7 system has been proposed so as to improve correction performance against a bust error. As described above, in the optical disc 1 according to the present invention, in the area AR2, data is encoded with the error correction code according to the CIRC7 system and recorded. Moreover, in the area AR2, a pattern of data that can be decoded according to any one of the CIRC7 system and the CIRC4 system is contained. Next, data that can be decoded according to any one of the CIRC7 system and the CIRC4 system will be described. As was described above, since the CIRC4 system and the CIRC7 system differ in their interleave lengths, data that has been encoded with the error correction code according to the CIRC7 system can be decoded by a decoder according to the CIRC4 system. In contrast, data that has been encoded with the error correction code according to the CIRC4 system cannot be decoded by the decoder according to the CIRC7 system. However, when data is a particular array, it can be decode by any one of a decoder according to the CIRC4 system and a decoder according to the CIRC7 system. Fig. 13 describes a data array that can be decoded by any one of a decoder according to the CIRC4 system and a decoder according to the CIRC7 system. In the data array shown in Fig. 13, when data is two-dimensionally arrayed, predetermined data is repeated as one unit in the vertical direction, namely in the unit of a C1 sequence. In the example, data is repeated as one unit of a1, a2, a3, and a4 in the vertical direction. In such a data array, the same data is arranged in the horizontal direction. In other words, as shown in Fig. 13, data of the first row in the horizontal direction is all a1. Data of the second row in the horizontal direction is all a2. Data of the third row in the horizontal direction is all a3. Data of the fourth row in the horizontal direction is a4. In such a manner, the same data is arranged in the horizontal direction. When data is arrayed in such a manner, like the C1 sequence, the C2 sequence according to the CIRC4 system is the same as the C2 sequence according to the CIRC7 system. In other words, in the example shown in Fig. 12, regardless of the total interleave length (namely, the angle of the diagonal direction), the parity of the C2 sequence is always composed of a1, a2, a3, and a4. Thus, when data is arrayed in such a manner, data that has been encoded with the error correction code according to the CIRC7 system can be decoded by a decoder according to the CIRC4 system. Reversely, data that has been encoded with the error correction code according to the CIRC4 system can be decoded by a decoder according to the CIRC7 system. Thus, since the interleave length according to the CIRC4 system is different from the interleave length according to the CIRC7 system, data that has been encoded with the error correction code according to the CIRC7 system cannot be decoded by a decoder according to the CIRC4 system. In addition, data that has been encoded with the error correction code according to the CIRC4 system cannot be decoded by a decoder according to the CIRC7 system. As was described above, however, when predetermined data is repeated in the vertical direction, the data can be decoded by any one of a decoder according to the CIRC7 system and a decoder according to the CIRC4 system. Fig. 14A and Fig. 14B show a structure of a recording apparatus that creates data that is recorded on the forgoing optical disc 1. In Fig. 14A and Fig. 14B, digital audio data as content data to be recorded in the program area PA1 is supplied to an input terminal 51. Content data to be recorded in the program area PA2 is supplied to an input terminal 52. The content data is digital audio data that has been compressed according to for example the ATRAC3. The content data, which has been input from the input terminal 52, is supplied to an encrypting circuit 55. Content key data KC is supplied from a content key generating circuit 56 to the encrypting circuit 55. The encrypting circuit 55 encrypts the content data with the content key data KC supplied from the content key generating circuit 56. The encrypted content data is supplied to an error correction code encoding circuit 54. The error correction code encoding circuit 54 performs an error correction code encoding process according to the CIRC4 system. The content key data KC supplied from the content key generating circuit 56 is supplied to the encrypting circuit 55. In addition, the content key data KC is supplied to a key locker data generating circuit 57. A DRM generating circuit 58 generates copyright management data DRM about the content data. The copyright management data represents for example permission or prohibition of reproducing operation of content data, permission or prohibition of copy operation of content data, and permission of copy operation of one generation or multiple generations of content data. The key locker data generating circuit 57 encodes the content key data KC and the copyright management data DRM and generates key locker data. Output data of the key locker data generating circuit 57 is supplied to a key locker data encrypting circuit 59. The key locker data key KL is supplied from a hash calculating circuit 60 to the key locker data encrypting circuit 59. The key locker data generated by the key locker data generating circuit 57 is encrypted by the key locker data encrypting circuit 59 with the key locker data key KL supplied from the hash calculating circuit 60. The hash calculating circuit 60 generates the key locker data key KL with device key data KD and hidden key data KH. In other words, the device key data KD is supplied from an input terminal 61 to the hash calculating circuit 60. In addition, hidden key data KH is supplied from a hidden key data generating circuit 62 to the hash calculating circuit 60. The device key data KD is stored as intrinsic data somewhere in the device. The hidden key data KH is generated by the hidden key data generating circuit 62 using random numbers. The hash calculating circuit 60 performs a hash calculation with the device key data KD supplied from the input terminal 61 and the hidden key data KH supplied from the hidden key data generating circuit 62 and generates the key locker data key KL. The key locker data key KL is supplied to the key locker data encrypting circuit 59. The key locker data encrypting circuit 59 encrypts key locker data data generated by the key locker data generating circuit 57 with the key locker data key KL supplied from the hash calculating circuit 60. The encrypted key locker data K_LOCK is supplied to an error correction code encoding circuit 54 according to the CIRC4 system. A software player generating circuit 63 generates data of the software player SFT1 as program data for decrypting encrypted data. The data of the software player SFT1 is supplied to the error correction code encoding circuit 54 according to the CIRC4 system. The error correction code encoding circuit 54 according to the CIRC4 system dually performs an error correction code encoding process for the C1 sequence (in the vertical direction) and the C2 sequence (in the diagonal direction). According to the CIRC4 system, the delay unit D is (D = 4 frames) and the maximum delay amount is 27D (= 108 frames). On the other hand, the hidden key data KH supplied from the hidden key data generating circuit 62 is supplied to a CIRC4/CIRC7 pattern converting circuit 65. The CIRC4/CIRC7 pattern converting circuit 65 converts information of the hidden key data KH supplied from the hidden key data generating circuit 62 into data that can be decoded according to any one of the CIRC4 system and the CIRC7 system. The data that can be decoded according to any one of the CIRC4 system and the CIRC7 system is data of which predetermined data is repeated as one unit in the vertical direction (C1 sequence) in the case that data is two-dimensionally arrayed. An output of the CIRC4/CIRC7 pattern converting circuit 65 is supplied to an mixing circuit 66. Other data to be recorded in the area AR2 is supplied from an input terminal 70 to the mixing circuit 66. Data to be recorded in the area AR2 may be any type of data. For example, the data to be recorded in the area AR2 may be data that can be reproduced by a device that has a decoder according to the CIRC7 system. The mixing circuit 66 mixes the data supplied from the input terminal 70 and the information of the hidden key data KH supplied from the CIRC4/CIRC7 pattern converting circuit 65 at a predetermined position. The position at which the data supplied from the input terminal 69 and the hidden key data KH supplied from the CIRC4/CIRC7 pattern converting circuit 65 are mixed is designated by a mixing position designating circuit 69 corresponding to a position described in the software player SFT1. An output of the mixing circuit 66 is supplied to an error correction code encoding circuit 67 according to the CIRC7 system. The error correction code encoding circuit 67 according to the CIRC7 system dually performs an error correction code encoding process for the C1 sequence (in the vertical direction) and the C2 sequence (in the diagonal direction). According to the CIRC7 system, the delay unit D is (D = 7 frames) and the maximum delay amount is 27D (= 189 frames). Outputs of the error correction code encoding circuit 54 according to the CIRC4 system and the error correction code encoding circuit 67 according to the CIRC7 system are supplied to a sub code adding circuit 71. An output of the sub code adding circuit 71 is supplied to a modulating circuit 72. The modulating circuit 72 EFM-modulates record data. The optical disc 1 is held on a turn table (not shown) and rotated by a spindle motor 73. The rotations of the spindle motor 73 are driven at constant linear velocity (CLV) or constant angular velocity (CAV) by a spindle controlling circuit 75 under the control of a servo controlling circuit 74. The servo controlling circuit 74 generates a focus error signal, a tracking error signal, and various types of servo drive signals such as a focus servo drive signal, a tracking servo drive signal, a thread servo drive signal, and a spindle servo drive signal corresponding to an operation command received from a system controller 80 and outputs the generated signals to the actuator controlling circuit 76, a thread controlling circuit 77, and the spindle controlling circuit 75. An optical pickup 78 is a mechanism that focus a laser beam of a semiconductor laser as a light source on a signal surface of the optical disc 1 and scans tracks formed in a concentric circle shape or a spiral shape on the optical disc 1. The laser beam radiated from the optical pickup 78 scans tracks corresponding to a surface deviation and eccentricity of the optical disc 1 as the an objective lens supported by an actuator is traveled in the focus direction and the tracking direction. An actuator is controlled by an actuator 76 under the control of the servo controlling circuit 74. The entire optical pickup 78 can be traveled by a thread mechanism 79 in the radial direction of the disc. The traveling of the thread mechanism 79 is controlled by the thread controlling circuit 77 under the control of the servo controlling circuit 74. Output data of the modulating circuit 72 is supplied to the optical pickup 78. The optical pickup 78 outputs a laser beam whose waveform has been modulated corresponding to the output data of the modulating circuit 72. The laser beam is radiated on the record surface of the optical disc 1 and information is recorded on the optical disc 1. When digital audio data is recoded in the program area PA1 of the optical disc 1, the digital audio data supplied from the input terminal 51 is supplied to the error correction code encoding circuit 54 according to the CIRC4 system. The error correction code encoding circuit 54 performs an error correction code encoding process for the digital audio data according to the CIRC4 system. Output data of the error correction code encoding circuit 54 is supplied to the optical pickup 78 through the sub code adding circuit 71 and the modulating circuit 72 and recorded on the optical disc 1. When encrypted content data is recorded in the program area PA2 of the optical disc 1, the content data supplied from the input terminal 52 is encrypted by the encrypting circuit 55.

The content key data KC with which the content data is encrypted is generated by the content key generating circuit 56. The content key data KC is encoded along with the copyright management data DRM supplied from the DRM generating circuit 58 by the key locker data generating circuit 57. As a result, key locker data is generated. The key locker data is encrypted with the key locker data key KL by the key locker data encrypting circuit 59. The encrypted key locker data K_LOCK is supplied to the error correction code encoding circuit 54 according to the CIRC4 system. Output data of the error correction code encoding circuit 54 is supplied to the optical pickup 78 through the sub code adding circuit 71 and the modulating circuit 72 and recorded on the optical disc 1. When data of the software player SFT1 is recorded in the program area PA2 of the optical disc 1, the data of the software player SFT1 is output from the software player generating circuit 63 and supplied to the error correction code encoding circuit 54 according to the CIRC4 system. Output data of the error correction code encoding circuit 54 is supplied to the optical pickup 78 through the sub code adding circuit 71 and the modulating circuit 72 and recorded on the optical disc 1. When data is recorded in the area AR2 of the program area PA2 of the optical disc 1, data supplied from the input terminal 70 is supplied to the error correction code encoding circuit 67 according to the CIRC7 system through the mixing circuit 66. The CIRC4/CIRC7 pattern converting circuit 65 supplies the hidden key data KH that can be decoded according to any one of the CIRC4 system and the CIRC7 system to the mixing circuit 66. A recording position of the hidden key data KH in the area AR2 is described in the software player SFT1 supplied from the software player generating circuit 63. The mixing position designating circuit 69 mixes the data supplied from the input terminal 68 and the hidden key data KH corresponding to the recording position described in the software player SFT1. An output of the mixing circuit 66 is supplied to the error correction code encoding circuit 67 according to the CIRC7 system. The error correction code encoding circuit 67 performs an error correction code encoding process for the digital audio data according to the CIRC7 system. Output data of the error correction code encoding circuit 67 is supplied to the optical pickup 78 through the sub code adding circuit 71 and the modulating circuit 72 and recorded on the optical disc 1. Fig. 15A and Fig. 15B show a structure of a reproducing apparatus that reproduces data from the optical disc 1. The reproducing apparatus is a conventional player or a conventional drive that performs a decrypting process for encrypted content by software. Thus, various key reproducing circuits, a key locker data reproducing circuit, and a content data decoding circuit are implemented by software. In this example, their functions are described with reference to block diagrams of Fig. 15A and Fig. 15B. Of course, those processes may be implemented by hardware. In Fig. 15A and Fig. 15B, the optical disc 1 is held on a turn table (not shown) and rotated by a spindle motor 81. The rotations of the spindle motor 81 are driven at constant linear velocity (CLV) or constant angular velocity (CAV) by a spindle controlling circuit 82 under the control of a servo controlling circuit 83. The servo controlling circuit 83 generates a focus error signal, a tracking error signal, and various types of servo drive signals such as a focus servo drive signal, a tracking servo drive signal, a thread servo drive signal, and a spindle servo drive signal corresponding to an operation command supplied from a system controller 80 and outputs the generated signals to an actuator controlling circuit 84, a thread controlling circuit 85, and the spindle controlling circuit 82. An optical pickup 87 is a mechanism that focuses a laser beam of a semiconductor laser as a light source on a signal surface of the optical disc 1 and scans tracks formed in a concentric circular shape or a spiral shape on the optical disc 1. The entire optical pickup 87 is traveled in the radial direction of the optical disc 1 by a thread mechanism 88. An output signal of the optical pickup 87 is supplied to a demodulating circuit 90 through an RF amplifier 89. The demodulating circuit 90 EFM-demodulates the signal supplied from the optical pickup 87. Output data of the demodulating circuit 90 is supplied to a sub code extracting circuit 91. The sub code extracting circuit 91 extracts sub code data from the data supplied from the demodulating circuit 90. Output data of the sub code extracting circuit 91 is supplied to an error correcting circuit 92. The error correcting circuit 92 performs an error correcting process according to the CIRC4 system. When CD-DA data is reproduced from the program area PA1 of the optical disc 1, the optical pickup 87 accesses the program area PA1 and reads data therefrom. An output signal of the optical pickup 87 is supplied to the error correcting circuit 92 through the RF amplifier 89, the demodulating circuit 90, and the sub code extracting circuit 91. The error correcting circuit 92 performs an error correcting process according to the CIRC4 system. The error correcting circuit 92 outputs audio data. The audio data is output from an output terminal 94 through a switching circuit 93. Content data in the program area PA2 of the optical disc 1 has been encrypted. Thus, when the content data in the program area PA2 is reproduced, it is necessary to decrypt the content data. When the content data in the program area PA2 is reproduced, the optical pickup 87 accesses the beginning of data of the area of the software player SFT1 in the program area PA2. Thus, the data in the software player SFT1 is supplied to the error correcting circuit 92 through the RF amplifier 89, the demodulating circuit 90, and the sub code extracting circuit 91. The error correcting circuit 92 performs an error correcting process according to the CIRC4 system. The error correcting circuit 92 outputs data of the software player SFT1. The data of the software player is sent to a software player starting portion 95 through the switching circuit 93. The software player starting portion 95 determines a position of data that can be decoded according to any one of the CIRC4 system and the CIRC7 system in the area AR2 corresponding to the data of the software player SFT1. After the position of data that can be decoded according to any one of the CIRC4 system and the CIRC7 system in the area AR2 has been obtained corresponding to the data of the software player SFT1, the optical pickup 87 accesses the obtained position. The data that can be decoded according to any one of the CIRC4 system and the CIRC7 system is supplied to the error correcting circuit 92 through the RF amplifier 89, the demodulating circuit 90, and the sub code extracting circuit 91. Output data of the error correcting circuit 92 is supplied to a hidden key reproducing circuit 96. The hidden key reproducing circuit 96 reproduces the hidden key data KH. The hidden key data KH that has been reproduced by the hidden key reproducing circuit 96 is supplied to a hash calculating circuit 97. Device key data KD that is intrinsic to the reproducing apparatus is supplied from an input terminal 104 to the hash calculating circuit 97. The hash calculating circuit 97 obtains the key locker data key KL with the hidden key data KH and the device key data KD. The key locker data key KL is supplied to a decrypting circuit 99. In such a manner, after the key locker data key KL has been obtained, the optical pickup 87 is traveled to the position of the key locker data K_LOCK of the program area PA2. At the position, the key locker data K_LOCK is reproduced. An output signal corresponding to the key locker data K_LOCK is output from the optical pickup 87 and supplied to a key locker data reproducing circuit 98 through the RF amplifier 89, the demodulating circuit 90, the sub code extracting circuit 91, the error correcting circuit 92, and the switching circuit 93. An output of the key locker data reproducing circuit 98 is supplied to the decrypting circuit 99. The decrypting circuit 99 decrypts the key locker data K_LOCK with the key locker data key KL supplied from the hash calculating circuit 97. Output data of the decrypting circuit 99 is supplied to a content key reproducing circuit 100. In addition, the output data of the decrypting circuit 99 is supplied to a copyright management data reproducing circuit 101. The content key reproducing circuit 100 extracts the content key data KC from the key locker data K_LOCK. The content key data KC is supplied to a decrypting circuit 102. The copyright management data reproducing circuit 101 extracts the copyright management data DRM from the key locker data K_LOCK. The copyright management data DRM is sent to the system controller 80. In such a manner, after the key locker data K_LOCK has been read from the optical disc 1 and the content key data KC has been read from the key locker data K_LOCK, the optical pickup 87 is traveled to the position of the content data of the program area PA2. The optical pickup 87 reads the encrypted content data from the position. The optical pickup 87 outputs a signal corresponding to the encrypted content data. The output signal is supplied to the decrypting circuit 102 through the RF amplifier 89, the demodulating circuit 90, the sub code extracting circuit 91, the error correcting circuit 92, and the switching circuit 93. The decrypting circuit 102 performs a decrypting process for the encrypted content data with the content key data KC supplied from the content key reproducing circuit 100. The decrypted content data is output from an output terminal 103. In the optical disc 1 according to the present invention, the hidden key data KH is recorded in the area AR2 in which the hidden key data KH has been encoded with the error correction code according to the CIRC7 system in such a manner that the data can be decoded according to any one of the CIRC7 system and the CIRC4 system. The recording position of the area AR2 is designated with data of the software player SFT1. In the forgoing example, in the area AR2 in which data has been encoded with the error correction code according to the CIRC7 system, the hidden key data KH is recorded in such a manner that the data can be decoded according to any one of the CIRC7 system and the CIRC4 system. However, the data that is recorded in such a manner that it can be decoded according to any one of the CIRC7 system and the CIRC4 system is not limited to the hidden key data KH. Alternatively, the content key data KC or the key locker data key KL may be recorded. Besides such key data, various types of data such as copyright management data and additional service data about disc and contents may be recorded in the area AR2 in such a manner that the data can be decoded according to any one of the CIRC7 system and the CIRC4 system. In other words, in the area AR2, various types of data are recorded in such a manner that they can be decoded according to any one of the CIRC7 system and the CIRC4 system. The software player SFT1 is data that represents the recoding position of those types of data. According to the present invention, the recoding position of data that has been recorded in such a manner that the data can be decoded according to any one of the CIRC7 system and the CIRC4 system is designated with the software player SFT1. However, the recording position may be designated by other than the software player SFT1. In the forgoing example, as shown in Fig. 1 and Fig. 2, the optical disc is a two-session optical disc that is divided into an inner periphery area and an outer periphery area in which data of CD-DA and compressed audio data that is encrypted are recorded. However, as shown in Fig. 16, of course, the optical disc may be a one-session optical disc. In the example shown in Fig. 16, a lead-in area LI is formed on the innermost periphery of the optical disc. A program area PA is formed on an outer periphery of the lead-in area LI. A lead-out area LO is formed outside the program area PA. The program area PA is divided into an area AR1 and an area AR2. In the area AR1, data that has been encoded with the error correction code according to the CIRC4 system is recorded. In the area AR2, key locker data K_LOCK2 and data of software player SFT1 are recorded. Moreover, in the area AR2, data that has been encoded with the error correction code according to the CIRC7 system is recorded. Furthermore, in the area AR2, data that can be decoded according to any one of the CIRC4 system and the CIRC7 system is recorded. The data contains the hidden key data KH. In the forgoing example, data that can be decoded according to any one of the CIRC4 system and the CIRC7 system has been described. However, predetermined data repeated as one unit in the vertical direction (C1 sequence) can be decoded regardless of the interleave length. In addition, data that can be decoded according to a plurality of error correction systems is not limited to data according to the CIRC system. In other words, another encoding system of which data can be encoded with error correction codes of two sequences can be considered. For example, in the case of a product code of which data is encoded in the horizontal direction and the vertical direction, like the CIRC, data that can be decoded with a plurality of error correction codes can be considered. In the forgoing optical disc 1, in the area AR2, data that has been encoded with the error correction code according to the CIRC7 system contains data that can be decoded according to any one of the CIRC4 system and the CIRC7 system. However, when a portion that contains data that can be decoded according to any one of the CIRC4 system and the CIRC7 system is mistakenly reproduced as a sound, a uncomfortable sound will be generated. Thus, in the data, all high order bits of the PCM signal are set to 0 so that the level of the sound becomes low. Of course, when 1 represents a low level sound, all the high order bits are set to 1. When a sound that is generated in a portion that can be decoded according to any one of the CIRC4 system and the CIRC7 system is a direct current (DC) or a radio frequency wave, since the user cannot easily recognize it, there is a risk of which he or she turns up the volume. Thus, data 0s and 1s in a predetermined pattern will be embedded in a portion that contains data that can be decoded according to any one of two systems. As a result, an audible band sound will be generated. For example, 0s and 1s will be repeated at 7.35 kHz. In some decoding circuit according to the CIRC system, unless an error takes place in the C1 sequence, an error correction process is not performed for the C2 sequence. For a process of a drive or a player that has such a decoding circuit, in a part of the area AR2, data that can be decoded according to any one of the CIRC4 system and the CIRC7 system will contain an error of the C1 sequence. According to the present invention, on a optical disc used as a data recoding medium, data that has been encoded with a plurality of (at least two) error correction codes is recorded. For example, in an area in which data that has been encoded with the error correction code according to the CIRC4 system is recorded, an area in which data is encoded with the error correction code according to the CIRC7 system is formed. In the area, data that can be decoded according to any one of the CIRC4 system and the CIRC7 system is recorded. When data of such an optical disc is decoded by a decoding circuit according to the CIRC4 system and disc-copied, since an error that cannot be corrected takes place in an area in which data is encoded with the error correction code according to the CIRC7 system, the data of the optical disc cannot be copied. Even if the data of the optical disc can be copied, the data is rewritten. When a part of key data is recorded in data that can be decoded according to any one of the CIRC4 system and the CIRC7 system, the security of the key data is improved. Industrial Utilization As described above, the present invention is a data recording medium such as a CD on which content data is encrypted and recorded, a recording method and apparatus for recording data on such a data recording medium, and a data reproducing method and apparatus for reproducing data from such a data recoding medium that are suitable for protecting content data.", "tags": ["H03M", "H04N", "G11B"]}

BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION 1. Field of the Invention The present invention relates to a receiver, a transmitter, a communication system, and a method of communication. 2. Description of the Related Art The multi-carrier code division multiple access (CDMA) transmission method was proposed in 1993 in MULTI-CARRIER CDMA IN INDOOR WIRELESS RADIO NETWORKS (N. Yee et al., 1993 IEEE Personal, Indoor and Mobile Radio Communications), and studies have been made regarding the application of the same to mobile communication systems since then. The multi-carrier CDMA transmission method is a method of transmission in which a data symbol is copied in the direction of a frequency axis; each of the copied data symbols is multiplied by one chip of a spreading code and spread; and the spread data signals are transmitted in parallel over a plurality of sub-carriers having different frequencies. The multi-carrier CDMA transmission method makes it possible to transmit a plurality of data symbols simultaneously. According to the multi-carrier CDMA transmission method, a data symbol is multiplied by a spreading code in the direction of a frequency axis. Therefore, according to the multi-carrier CDMA transmission method, a plurality of data symbols can be code-division-multiplexed by multiplying the data symbols by a spreading code orthogonal to each other. Further, a low symbol rate and a great symbol length are achieved by the multi-carrier CDMA method because parallel transmission is performed using a plurality of sub-carriers. As a result, the multi-carrier CDMA transmission method makes it possible to reduce the influence of so-called multipath interference that is problematic in a mobile communication environment. Multipath interference is interference which occurs between transmission signals when they arrive at a receiver at different timing via a plurality of different paths (a multipath) and which results in the degradation of signal transmission characteristics. In a multipath, frequency-selective fading occurs in which variations in the path occurs depending on frequency, the signal transmission characteristic varying depending on its frequency. According to the multi-carrier CDMA transmission method, a data signal is spread in the direction of a frequency axis. Therefore, according to the multi-carrier CDMA transmission method, a frequency diversity effect reduces the influence of variation in signal transmission characteristic, thus improving signal transmission characteristics. The multi-carrier CDMA transmission method has many advantages as thus described. However, the multi-carrier CDMA transmission method has the following problems. As shown in Figs. 1A and 1B, a receiver receives signals that are signals over a data channel #1 and a data channel #2 multiplexed and transmitted. The receiver multiplies the reception signals by a spreading code in the direction of frequencies, the spreading code being identical to a spreading code that has been multiplied at the transmitter. Then, the receiver performs despreading by combining the reception signals of each sub-carrier over the spreading code duration of the spreading codes. As shown in Fig. 1A, when the propagation path variation value of the sub-carriers has a constant, the spreading codes multiplied on the data symbols in the respective data channels are orthogonal to each other. Therefore, the data symbols in the respective data channels #1 and #2 are completely recovered in the reception signals after despreading. In practice, however, since the sub-carriers are subjected to different amplitude variations and phase variations as shown in Fig. 1B, the propagation path variation value will not have a constant. Therefore, the orthogonality of the spreading codes multiplied on the reception signals in the respective data channels received after propagating on the multipath is destructed. As a result, the data symbols in the respective data channels #1 and #2 can be not completely recovered from the reception signals after despreading, and the data symbols in the data channels interfere with each other and remain, which degrades signal transmission characteristics. In order to solve such a problem, a method in which a receiver multiplies a reception signal over each sub-carrier by weights and combines signals to reduce interference between data symbols in data channels has been proposed in Design and Performance of Multicarrier CDMA System in Frequency-Selective Rayleigh Fading Channels (S. Hara et al., IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON VEHICULAR TECHNOLOGY, pp. 1584-1595, VLO. 48, NO. 5, September 1999), for example. Diversity combining is a technique for reducing the influence of variation in signal transmission characteristics depending on frequency by the above-described effect of frequency-selective fading, and improving signal transmission characteristics. One scheme for diversity combining is antenna diversity combining in which signals are received by a plurality of antennas and in which combining is performed with the signal received of each of the antennas multiplied by weights. For example, a method for weighting in antenna diversity combining has been proposed in Linear Diversity Combining Techniques (D. G. Brennan, Proc. IRE, pp. 1075-1102, VOL. 47, NO. 6, June 1959). A proposal has recently been made in which antenna diversity combining is applied to the orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) multi-carrier transmission method (CO-CHANNEL INTERFERENCE SUPPRESSION ASSISTED ADAPTIVE OFDM IN INTERFERENCE LIMITED ENVIRONMENTS (M. M\u00fcnster et al., IEEE Vehicular Technology Conference-Fall, 1999)). However, studies have been made only on the application of antenna diversity to the OFDM multi-carrier transmission method, and no study has been made at all on the application of antenna diversity combining in the multi-carrier CDMA transmission method. BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION An object of the present invention, is to apply appropriately antenna diversity combining to the multi-carrier CDMA transmission method to reduce the influence of interference between data channels and to thereby improve signal transmission characteristics. A receiver according to an aspect of the present invention comprises a plurality of antennas configured to receive signals that are obtained by multiplying a plurality of data symbols transmitted over a plurality of data channels using spreading codes for each of the data channels, the data symbol being transmitted over a plurality of sub-carriers having different frequencies, a spreading code multiplier configured to multiply the reception signals received by the plurality of antennas using spreading codes for the data channels corresponding to the reception signals, a weight controller configured to adjust antenna weights by which the reception signal received by each antenna is to be multiplied and sub-carrier weights by which the reception signal received over each sub-carrier is to be multiplied, a weight multiplier configured to multiply the reception signals by the antenna weights and the sub-carrier weights adjusted by the weight controller, and a combining unit configured to combine the reception signals multiplied by the antenna weights and the sub-carrier weights at the weight multiplier among the antennas and over the spreading code duration of the spreading codes. In such a receiver, the plurality of antennas receive signals that are obtained by multiplying a plurality of data symbols using spreading codes for each of the data channels and that are transmitted over a plurality of sub-carriers having different frequencies. The spreading code multiplier multiplies the reception signals using spreading codes for the data channels corresponding to the reception signals. The weight multiplier multiplies the reception signals by the antenna weights which is adjusted by the weight controller and by which the signal received by each antenna is multiplied and sub-carrier weights which is adjusted by the weight controller and by which the signal received over each sub-carrier is multiplied. The combining unit combines the reception signals multiplied by the antenna weights and sub-carrier weights among the antennas and over the spreading code duration of the spreading codes. Thus, the reception signals are multiplied by the antenna weights and sub-carrier weights adjusted by the weight controller. Therefore, the spreading codes for each of the data channels which the reception signals are multiplied are orthogonal to each other. As a result, the data symbols are less affected by interference between the data channels that is caused by the destruction of orthogonality between the spreading codes. As thus described, the receiver can improve the signal transmission characteristics by appropriately applying antenna diversity combining to the multi-carrier CDMA transmission method.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION With reference to the drawings, embodiments of the present invention will be described below. [First Embodiment] (Communication System) As shown in Fig. 2, a communication system 1 comprises a transmitter 4 and a receiver 5. The transmitter 4 is provided at a base station 2, for example. The receiver 5 is provided in a terminal apparatus 3, for example. The transmitter 4 transmits signals using the multi-carrier CDMA transmission method in which signals obtained by multiplying a plurality of data symbols transmitted on a plurality of data channels by a spreading code are transmitted over a plurality of sub-carriers having different frequencies. The receiver 5 receives the signals transmitted by the transmitter 4 according to the multi-carrier CDMA transmission method. The communication system is not limited to one-to-one communication between the transmitter 4 and the receiver 5 as shown in Fig. 2, and a communication system may be employed which allows communication between one transmitter 4 and a plurality of receivers 5, communication between a plurality of transmitters 4 and one receiver 5, or communication between a plurality of transmitters 4 and a plurality of receivers 5. Alternatively, the communication system may be a communication system in which a transmitter 4 or receiver 5 relays a signal to another transmitter 4 or receiver 5. (Transmitter) As shown in Fig. 3, the transmitter 4 comprises a plurality of signal processing unit 41 1 to 41n, a pilot symbol inserting unit 41h, a signal combining unit 42, a frequency/time converter 43, a guard interval inserting unit 44, and an antenna 45. The signal processing units 41 1 to 41n are provided in the same quantity as a plurality of data channels #1 to #n. The signal processing units 41 1 to 41n associated with the data channels #1 to #n process transmission signals such as data signals and pilot signals transmitted over the data channels #1 to #n. The signal processing units 41 1 to 41n comprise a data symbol generating unit 41a, an error-correction-encoder 41b, a data modulator 41c, a serial/parallel converter 41d, a spreading code generating unit 41e, a plurality of symbol copier 41f, and a plurality of spreading code multiplier 41g. The data symbol generating unit 41a generates data symbols to be transmitted over the data channels associated therewith. Specifically, the data symbol generating units 41a of the respective signal processing units 41 1 to 41n generate data symbols associated with the respective data channels #1 to #n. The data symbol generating unit 41a generates data symbols of data such as images and sounds to be transmitted to the terminal apparatus 3. For example, data symbol generating circuit that generates data symbols may be used as the data symbol generating unit 41a. The error-correction-encoder 41b perform error-correction encoding on data symbols generated by the data symbol generating units 41a. The error-correction-encoder 41b performs turbo encoding or convolutional encoding, for example. Thus, the receiver 5 can perform error-correction-decoding. Therefore, the receiver 5 can obtain an encoding gain (a quantity of improvement that is a reduction in power required for reception achieved by applying an error-correcting encoding) to improve communication quality. The data modulator 41c performs a data modulating process on a data symbol that has been subjected to error-correction-encoding. The data modulator 41c performs multivalued quadrature amplitude modulation (QAM) such as 16-QAM and 64-QAM, binary phase shift keying (BPSK) modulation, or quadrature phase shift keying (QPSK) modulation. The serial/parallel converter 41d is a divider configured to divide a data symbol into a plurality of data symbols. The serial/parallel converter 41d performs serial/parallel conversion of a data symbol in order to transmit a plurality of data symbols at the same time. Specifically, the serial/parallel converter 41d divide a serial data symbol input from the data modulator 41c at constant intervals, converting it into data symbols that are arranged in parallel in the direction of a frequency axis. The symbol copiers 41f copy the plurality of data symbols obtained by the serial/parallel conversion and division at the serial/parallel converter 41d in a quantity that is equal to a number of spreading code duration of the spreading codes corresponding to the data channels #1 to #n over which the data symbols are transmitted. The spreading code generating unit 41e generates the spreading codes corresponding to the respective data channels and assigned to the data channels. The spreading code generating unit 41e inputs the generated spreading codes to the spreading code multiplier 41g. The spreading code multipliers 41g multiply the data symbols copied by the symbol copiers 41f using the spreading codes corresponding to the data channels #1 to #n over which the data symbols are transmitted to provide data signals. The spreading code multipliers 41g multiply the respective copied data symbols using the spreading codes input thereto from the spreading code generating unit 41e in the direction of the frequency axis. The spreading code multipliers 41g are provided in a quantity that is equal to the number of the spreading code duration of the spreading codes corresponding to the data channels #1 to #n over which the data symbols are transmitted. The. spreading code multipliers 41g input the data signals obtained by multiplying the data symbols using the spreading codes to the signal combining unit 42. The pilot symbol inserting unit 41h inserts pilot symbol into the data symbols to generate transmission signals 6 that are data signals multiplexed with pilot signals. The pilot symbol is symbol whose amplitude and phase are known to the receiver 5. The pilot symbol is used by the receiver 5 to estimate propagation path variation in the reception signal and an error between a reception signal and a transmission signal after despreading. Referring to the pilot symbols, common pilot symbols may be used in the plurality of data channels #1 to #n, and different pilot symbols may alternatively be used in each of the data channels #1 to #n. Propagation path variation is variation in the phase and amplitude of a signal transmitted by the transmitter 4 that occur on the same when it is propagated in a propagation path between the transmitter 4 and the receiver 5 before it is received by the receiver 5. That is, propagation path variation indicates how much the phase and amplitude of a signal transmitted by the transmitter 4 changes before it is received by the receiver 5 after being propagated in a propagation path between the transmitter 4 and the receiver 5. Such estimation of a propagation path variation in a reception signal is referred to as \"channel estimation\". Therefore, propagation path variation in a reception signal obtained through channel estimation is specially called \"channel estimated value\". The transmitter 4 performs code-division-multiplexing in order to multiplex pilot signals and data signals in the direction of a spreading code axis. The pilot signal inserting unit 41h provides the signal combining unit 42 with the input of pilot signals obtained by multiplying pilot symbols using spreading codes different from those of the signal processing units 41 1 to 41n as well as the signal processing units 41 1 to 41n of the plurality of data channels #1 to #n. The term \"insertion of pilot symbols\" implies not only inserting pilot symbols as they are but also inserting pilot symbols after converting them into pilot signals by multiplying them using spreading codes. The signal combining unit 42 combines the data signals in the respective data channels #1 to #n input from the spreading code multiplier 41g of the signal processing units 41 1 to 41n of the respective data channels, thereby code-division-multiplexing the same. Not only the data signals of the respective data channels #1 to #n but also the pilot signals are input to the signal combining unit 42 of the transmitter 4 by the pilot symbol inserting unit 41h. Therefore, the signal combining unit 42 combines the data signals and pilot signals to perform code-division-multiplexing on the same. The frequency/time converter 43 is a spreading unit configured to spread the data signals multiplied using spreading codes at the spreading code multiplier 41g and code-division-multiplexed by the signal combining unit 42 over a plurality of sub-carriers having different frequencies for transmitting the data signals. The frequency/time converter 43 performs frequency/time signal conversion on the data signals to assign the data signals to the plurality of sub-carriers having different frequencies, thereby generating a multi-carrier CDMA signal. For example, an inverse fast Fourier transform (IFFT) apparatus may be used as the frequency/time converter 43 to perform an inverse fast Fourier transform process. The guard interval inserting unit 44 inserts a guard interval in each of the data signals spread over the plurality of sub-carriers by the frequency/time converter 43. The guard interval is inserted between the data signals to prevent interference between the data signals. The insertion of the guard intervals makes it possible to reduce the influence of interference between the data signals that is attributable to a delay of each data signal in arriving at the receiver 5 as a result of multipath propagation. As a guard interval, the guard interval inserting unit 44 may insert a signal obtained by copying a part of the waveform of a data signal or a signal having a predetermined pattern, for example. The length of a guard interval may be determined taking the delay time into consideration. The antenna 45 transmits a multi-carrier CDMA signal having guard intervals inserted therein to the receiver 5 as a transmission signal 6. Since pilot signals and data signals have been code-division-multiplexed at the transmitter 4, there is provided a transmission signal 6a in which pilot signals 62a and data signals 61a are code-division-multiplexed with different spreading codes in the direction of a spreading code axis as shown in Fig. 4A. The transmission signal 6a is a multi-carrier CDMA signal that is spread in the direction of the frequency axis or spread over the frequencies of a plurality of sub-carriers. Thus, when the pilot signals 62a and the data signals 61a are code-division-multiplexed, the duration of one frame of the transmission signal 6a can be made short to achieve improved frame efficiency. Pilot signals and data signals may be multiplexed through time-division-multiplexing that is multiplexing in the direction of a time axis. When time-division-multiplexing is performed, for example, a transmitter 204 as shown in Fig. 5 may be used. In the transmitter 204, pilot signals and data signals are time-division-multiplexed. In the transmitter 204, data symbol generating unit 41a, error-correction-encoder 41b, data modulator 41c, and spreading code generating unit 41e of respective signal processing units 241 1 to 241n, a frequency/time converter 43, a guard interval inserting unit 44, and an antenna 45 are substantially the same as those of the transmitter 4 shown in Fig. 3. Therefore, in Fig. 5 they are indicated by like symbols to those for the transmitter 4 and will not be described here. The pilot symbol inserting unit 241h inputs pilot symbols to the serial/parallel converter 241d at different times to when the data modulator 41c inputs data symbols to the serial/parallel converter 241d. Thus, the data symbols and the pilot symbols are time-division-multiplexed. Specifically, the data symbols output by the data modulator 41c and the pilot symbols output by the pilot symbol inserting unit 241h are input to the serial/parallel converter 241d at different times by switching unit 241i that input the data symbols and the pilot symbols to the serial/parallel converter 241d on a switched basis. The serial/parallel converter 241d performs serial/parallel conversion on the time-division-multiplexed data symbols and pilot symbols similarly to the serial/parallel converter 41d. Symbol copiers 241f copies the time-division-multiplexed data symbols and pilot symbols similarly to the symbol copier 41f. Spreading code multipliers 241g multiply the time-division-multiplexed data symbols and pilot symbols using spreading codes similarly to the spreading code multipliers 41g to provide time-division-multiplexed data signals and pilot signals. The spreading code multipliers 241g of the respective data channels #1 to #n input the data signals and pilot signals which have been multiplied using the spreading codes and time-division-multiplexed to a signal combining unit 242. The signal combining unit 242 combines the time-division-multiplexed data signals and pilot signals in the respective data channels #1 to #n input from the spreading code multipliers 241g of the signal processing units 241 1 to 241n of the respective data channels to perform code-division-multiplexing on the same. As a result, a transmission signal 6b transmitted by the transmitter 204 is a transmission signal in which pilot signals 62b and data signals 61b are time-division-multiplexed in the direction of the time axis as shown in Fig. 4B. Since time-division-multiplexed data signals and pilot signals are multiplied using spreading codes to be code-division-multiplexed, the transmission signal 6c becomes a multi-carrier CDMA signal in which the pilot signals 62b are code-division-multiplexed as well as the data signals 61b. Thus, when the pilot signals 62b and the data signals 61b are time-division-multiplexed, no inter-code interference occurs between the pilot signals 62b as shown in Fig. 4B. Therefore, estimation accuracy of the receiver 5 can be improved for estimating the propagation path variation and error between a reception signal and a transmission signal 6 after despreading using pilot signals 62b thus received. Pilot signals and data signals may be multiplexed through frequency-division-multiplexing that is multiplexing in the direction of a frequency axis. When frequency-division-multiplexing is performed, for example, a transmitter 304 as shown in Fig. 7 may be used. In the transmitter 304, pilot signals and data signals are frequency-division-multiplexed. In the transmitter 304, data symbol generating unit 41a, error-correction-encoder 41b, data modulator 41c, serial/parallel converter 41d, spreading code generating units 41e, symbol copiers 41f of respective signal processing units 341 1 to 341n, a frequency/time converter 43, a guard interval inserting unit 44, and an antenna 45 are substantially the same as those of the transmitter 4 shown in Fig. 3. Therefore, in Fig. 7 they are indicated by like symbols to those for the transmitter 4 and will not be described here. Pilot symbol inserting unit 341h inputs pilot symbols to spreading code multipliers 341g. Instead of inputting pilot symbols to all of a plurality of spreading code multipliers 341g, the pilot symbol inserting unit 341h inputs the same at intervals each of which is provided by skipping several spreading code multipliers 341g. That is, the pilot symbol inserting unit 341h inputs the pilot symbols to some of the plurality of spreading code multipliers 341g. Thus, the pilot symbols are inserted at some particular frequencies to allow data symbols and the pilot symbols to be frequency-division-multiplexed. At the spreading code multipliers 341g to which the pilot symbols have been input, the data symbols and pilot symbols are multiplied using spreading codes as done in the spreading code multipliers 41g. The spreading code multipliers 341g of the respective data channels #1 to #n input the resultant frequency-division-multiplexed data signals and pilot signals multiplied using the spreading codes to a signal combining unit 342. The signal combining unit 342 combines the frequency-division-multiplexed data signals and pilot signals in the data channels #1 to #n input from the spreading code multipliers 341g of the signal processing units 341 1 to 341n of the respective data channels, performing code-division-multiplexing on the same. As a result, a transmission signal 6c transmitted by the transmitter 304 is a transmission signal in which pilot signals 62c and data signals 61c are multiplexed in the direction of the frequency axis as shown in Fig. 4C. Since frequency-division-multiplexed data signals and pilot signals are code-division-multiplexed, the transmission signal 6c becomes a multi-carrier CDMA signal in which the pilot signals 62c are code-division-multiplexed as well as the data signals 61c. Thus, when the pilot signals 62c and the data signals 61c are frequency-division-multiplexed, the duration of one frame of the transmission signal 6c can be kept short thus achieving improved frame efficiency. The pilot signals may be transmitted in a signal format different from that of the data signals. Referring to the spreading codes by which the pilot symbols are multiplied, a common spreading code may be used in the plurality of data channels #1 to #n, and a different spreading code may alternatively be used in each of the data channels #1 to #n. In such transmitters 4, 204, and 304, the serial/parallel converters 41d and 241d divide each of the data symbols transmitted over the plurality of data channels #1 to #n into a plurality of data symbols. The symbol copiers 41f and 241f copy data symbols in quantities equal to the numbers of the spreading code duration of spreading codes corresponding to the data channels #1 to #n over which the data symbols are transmitted. The spreading code generating unit 41e generate spreading codes corresponding to the data channels. The spreading code multipliers 41g, 241g, and 341g multiply the copied data symbols using the spreading codes to obtain data signals. The frequency/time converter 43 spreads the data signals and pilot signals over a plurality of sub-carriers having different frequencies . The guard interval inserting unit 44 inserts a guard interval in each of the data signals spread over the plurality of sub-carriers. Thus, the transmitters 4, 204, and 304 can simultaneously transmit a plurality of data signals in a plurality of data channels #1 to #n over a plurality of sub-carriers having different frequencies. The transmitters 4, 204, and 304 can reduce the influence of interference between a plurality of data signals attributable to delay in the data signals in arriving at a receiver as a result of multipath propagation. Therefore, the transmitters 4, 204, and 304 can provide improved signal transmission characteristics. Further, the transmitters 4, 204, and 304 have the respective pilot symbol inserting units 41h, 241h, and 341h that insert pilot symbols in data symbols. The transmitters 4, 204, and 304 are thus capable of transmitting the pilot symbols to the receivers 5 and 205 along with the data symbols, the pilot symbols having amplitudes and phases known to the receivers 5 and 205. Therefore, the receiver can compare an actually received pilot symbol with a pilot symbol having a known amplitude and phase to be transmitted by the transmitter 4, 204, or 304 to find propagation path variation in the pilot symbol and any error between the received despread pilot symbol and the transmitted pilot symbol. The receiver can perform channel estimation using the propagation path variation in the pilot symbol. The receiver can also estimate an error between a reception signal and a transmission signal after despreading using errors of pilot symbols. (Receiver) As shown in Fig. 8, the receiver 5 comprises a plurality of antennas 51 1 to 51n, a plurality of signal processing units 52 1 to 52n, a weight controller 8, an antenna signal combining unit 53, a plurality of sub-carrier weight multipliers 54, a plurality of symbol combining units 55, a serial/parallel converter 56, a data demodulator 57, an error-correction-decoder 58, and a data symbol recovering unit 59. The plurality of antennas 51 1 to 51n receive a multi-carrier CDMA signals which are signals obtained by multiplying a plurality of data symbols transmitted by the transmitter 4 and transmitted over the plurality of data channels #1 to #n using spreading codes for each of the data channels and that are transmitted over a plurality of sub-carriers having different frequencies. Hereinafter, the signal received by the antennas 51 1 to 51n is called a reception signal 7. The reception signal 7 includes not only data signals but also pilot signals and guard interval. The signal processing units 52 1 to 52n are provided in a quantity that is equal to the number of the plurality of antennas 51 1 to 51n. The signal processing units 52 1 to 52n associated with the respective antennas 51 1 to 51n process the reception signal 7 that is a multi-carrier CDMA signal received by the antennas 51 1 to 51n. The signal processing units 52 1 to 52n comprise a symbol timing detector 52a, a guard interval deleting unit 52b, a time/frequency converter 52c, a spreading code generating unit 52d, a plurality of spreading code multipliers 52e, and a plurality of antenna weight multipliers 52f. The symbol timing detector 52a detects symbol timing for each of the reception signals 7 received by the plurality of antennas 51 1 to 51n. The guard interval deleting units 52b deletes guard intervals inserted between the reception signals 7. The time/frequency converter 52c performs time/frequency conversion on the reception signals 7 to demultiplex the reception signals 7 spread over the plurality of sub-carriers having different frequencies into a reception signal 7 on each of the sub-carriers. For example, a fast Fourier transform (FFT) apparatus may be used as the time/frequency converter 52c to perform a fast Fourier transform process. The spreading code generating unit 52d generates spreading codes that are identical to the spreading codes by which the reception signals 7 are multiplied. Specifically, the spreading code generating unit 52d generates spreading codes for the data channels #1 to #n over which the reception signals 7 have been transmitted. The spreading code generating unit 52d inputs the generated spreading codes to the spreading code multipliers 52e. The spreading code multipliers 52e multiply the reception signals 7 received by the plurality of antennas 51 1 to 51n using the spreading codes for the data channels corresponding to the reception signals 7. The spreading code multipliers 52c multiply the reception signals 7 on the respective sub-carriers demultiplexed by the time/frequency converter 52c using the spreading codes for the data channels #1 to #n over which the reception signals 7 have been transmitted in the direction of the frequency axis. By multiplying the reception signals 7 using the spreading codes thus described, the effect of the spreading codes being multiplied at the transmitter 4 is eliminated. As a result, the data signals and pilot signals included in the reception signals 7 become data symbols and pilot symbols. The spreading code multipliers 52e are provided in a quantity equal to the number of the sub-carriers. The respective spreading code multipliers 52e multiply the reception signals 7 on the respective sub-carriers. The spreading code multipliers 52e input the reception signals multiplied using the spreading codes to the antenna weight multipliers 52f. The weight controller 8 adjusts weights by which the signal 7 received by each antenna is multiplied (hereinafter referred to as \"antenna weight\") and weights by which the reception signal 7 on each sub-carrier is multiplied (hereinafter referred to as \"sub-carrier weight\"). The antenna weights include a weight by which the reception signal 7 is multiplied at each antenna before it is demultiplexed into each sub-carrier and a weight by which the reception signal 7 is multiplied at each antenna after it is demultiplexed into each sub-carrier. The sub-carrier weights include a weight by which the reception signal 7 is multiplied at each sub-carrier before the signals are combined among the antennas and a weight by which the reception signal 7 is obtained after combining among the antennas is multiplied at each sub-carrier. The inventors studied the application of antenna diversity combing in the multi-carrier CDMA transmission method and found that the following problem occurs when a receiver simply combines reception signals among the antennas after multiplying the reception signal over each sub-carrier of each of the antennas by a weight. When a reception signal on each of the sub-carriers at each of antennas is simply multiplied by a weight and combining is performed among the antennas as shown in Fig. 9, the power of the reception signal on each sub-carrier after the combining among the antennas can significantly change in the direction of the frequency from that before the combining among the antennas. This significantly destructs orthogonality between spreading codes by which data signals have been multiplied. When the reception signal on each sub-carrier after the combining among the antennas is multiplied by a spreading code and the signals are then despread by combining over the spreading code duration of the spreading codes, resultant data symbols after despreading are subjected to increased interference between the data channels, attributable to the destruction of the orthogonality between the spreading codes. That is, a simple application of antenna diversity combining in the multi-carrier CDMA transmission method can significantly degrade signal transmission characteristics. It is therefore important that the weight controller 8 adjusts antenna weights and sub-carrier weights such that the spreading codes for the plurality of data channels #1 to #n are orthogonal to each other. Therefore, the weight controller 8 adjusts antenna weights and sub-carrier weights such that spreading codes for the plurality of data channels #1 to #n are kept orthogonal to each other. The weight controller 8 preferably adjusts antenna weights and sub-carrier weights such that spreading codes for the plurality of data channels #1 to #n are orthogonal to each other and a great signal to noise power ratio (SNR) is achieved as possible. As a result, since the SNR of the reception signals 7 can be great, the receiver 5 is less affected by noise, thus achieving a further improvement in the signal transmission characteristics. The weight controller 8 adjusts the antenna weights and the sub-carrier weights to determine the antenna weights and the sub-carrier weights separately. The weight controller 8 comprises an antenna weight controller 81 and a sub-carrier weight controller 82. The antenna weight controller 81 determines the antenna weights and inputs the antenna weights to the antenna weight multipliers 52f. The sub-carrier weight controller 82 determines the sub-carrier weights and inputs the sub-carrier weights to the sub-carrier weight multipliers 54. The antenna weight multipliers 52f and the sub-carrier weight multipliers 54 constitute a weight multiplier configured to multiply the reception signals 7 by the antenna weights and the sub-carrier weights adjusted by the weight controller 8. The antenna signal combining unit 53 and the symbol combining units 55 constitute a combining unit configured to combine the reception signals 7 multiplied by the antenna weights and the sub-carrier weights at the weight multiplier among the antennas and over the spreading code duration of the spreading codes. The antenna weight multipliers 52f multiply the reception signal 7 received of each of the antennas 51 1 to 51n by the antenna weights. The antenna weight multipliers 52f multiply the reception signals 7 received by the antennas 51 1 to 51n that are processed by the signal processing units 52 1 to 52n by antenna weights. The antenna weight multipliers 52f are provided in a quantity equal to the number of sub-carriers. The respective antenna weight multipliers 52f multiply the reception signals 7 on the respective sub-carriers input from the respective spreading code multipliers 52e by antenna weights. The antenna weight multipliers 52f of the respective signal processing units 52 1 to 52n input the reception signals 7 each of which is multiplied by an antenna weight to the antenna signal combining unit 53. The sub-carrier weight multipliers 54 multiply the reception signals 7 on each of the sub-carriers by the sub-carrier weights. The sub-carrier weight multipliers 54 are provided in a quantity equal to the number of sub-carriers. The respective sub-carrier weight multipliers 54 multiply the reception signals 7 on the respective sub-carriers input from the antenna signal combining unit 53 by sub-carrier weights. The respective sub-carrier weight multipliers 54 input the reception signals 7 on the respective sub-carriers multiplied by the sub-carrier weights to the symbol combining units 55. The antenna signal combining unit 53 combines the reception signals 7 among the antennas 51 1 to 51n. The antenna signal combining unit 53 combines the reception signals 7 input from the antenna weight multipliers 52f of the signal processing units 52 1 to 52n among the antennas. Thus, antenna diversity combining is performed by multiplying the reception signals 7 received by the respective antennas 51 1 to 51n by antenna weights and combining the signals among the antennas. The symbol combining units 55 combine the reception signals 7 over the spreading code duration of the spreading codes. The plurality of symbol combining units 55 combine the reception signals 7 on each of the sub-carriers input from the sub-carrier weight multipliers 54 over the spreading code duration of the spreading codes for the data channels #1 to #n corresponding to the reception signals 7. Thus, multiplying the reception signals 7 on each of the sub-carriers multiplied using the spreading codes by the sub-carrier weights and combining the signals over the spreading code duration perform despreading. The symbol combining units 55 input the combined reception signals 7 to the serial/parallel converter 56. In the receiver 5, the spreading code multipliers 52e multiply the reception signals 7 on the respective sub-carriers using the spreading codes, and the antenna weight multipliers 52f thereafter multiply the reception signals 7 received by the respective antennas 51 1 to 51n by the antenna weights. The antenna signal combining unit 53 combines the reception signals 7 among the antennas 51 1 to 51n to perform antenna diversity combining. Thereafter, the sub-carrier weight multipliers 54 multiply the reception signals 7 on the respective sub-carriers combined among the antennas 51 1 to 51n by the sub-carrier weights. Finally, the symbol combining units 55 perform despreading by combining the reception signals 7 over the spreading code duration. As a result of the combining at the symbol combining units 55, the data symbols are recovered to the state of the same before the multiplication of spreading codes at the transmitter 4. The serial/parallel converter 56 performs parallel/serial conversion on the data symbols that have been recovered by being combined at the symbol combining units 55 over the spreading code duration. The serial/parallel converter 56 is a connecting unit that connects a plurality of data symbols into a single data symbol. The serial/parallel converter 56 connects data symbols that are divided at constant intervals and arranged in parallel in the direction of the frequency axis to convert them into a single serial data symbol. The data demodulator 57 performs a data demodulation process on the data symbol obtained as a result of parallel/serial conversion at the serial/parallel converter 56. The data demodulator 57 performs the data demodulating process in accordance with the modulation performed by the data modulators 41c of the transmitter 4, 204, or 304. The error-correction-decoder 58 performs an error-correction-decoding process on data symbols obtained as a result of the data demodulation process at the data demodulator 57. The error-correction-decoder 58 performs the error-correction-decoding process in accordance with the error-correction-coding performed by the error-correction-encoder 41b of the transmitter 4, 204, or 304. Thus, the receiver 5 can obtain a coding gain, thus achieving improved communication quality. The data symbol recovering unit 59 recovers the data symbols that have been subjected to the error-correction-decoding process at the error-correction-decoder 58 to a state in which they can be output to an output apparatus such as a display or speaker and outputs them to the output apparatus. Thus, data such as images and sounds are output. Next, an antenna weight controller 81 and a sub-carrier weight controller 82 will be described in detail. Antenna weight controllers 811 to 813 shown in Figs. 10A, 10B, and 10C may be used as the antenna weight controller 81, for example. As shown in Fig. 10A, the antenna weight controller 811 comprises a signal power comparator 811a and a selector 811b. The signal power comparator 811a detects and compares the power of reception signals 7 received by the plurality of antennas 51 1 to 51n. As the power of the reception signals 7, the signal power comparator 811a detects and compares the power of the reception signals 7 themselves and the power of signals that are obtained by eliminating the effect of noises etc. from the reception signals 7. The signal power comparator 811a determines an antenna weight 811c such that reception signals 7 from the antennas having the reception signal 7 with the maximum power are weighted by \"1\" and such that reception signals 7 from the other antennas are weighted by \"0\". The selector 811b selects reception signals 7 from the antennas weighted by \"1\" according to the antenna weight 811c. Therefore, the selector 811b selects only reception signals 7 from the antennas having the reception signal 7 having the maximum power. The antenna weight controller 811 inputs the determined antenna weight 811c to the antenna weight multipliers 52f. As a result, only the reception signals 7 from the selected antennas are input to the antenna signal combining unit 53, and a reception signal obtained by combining among the antennas 51 1 to 51n at the antenna signal combining unit 53 is output. Hereinafter, such a method of determining an antenna weight 811c and combining weights among the antennas 51 1 to 51n is referred to as \"selective combining method\". Such the antenna weight controller 811 is advantageous in that it allows a simple configuration. As shown in Fig. 10B, the antenna weight controller 812 has a weight storage unit 812a. The weight storage unit 812a stores a weight of a prescribed value. The antenna weight controller 812 determines the weight of a constant value stored in the weight storage unit 812a as an antenna weight 812b by which the antennas 51 1 to 51 n are to be multiplied. Therefore, the reception signals 7 from all of the antennas 51 1 to 51n are multiplied by equal antenna weights. The antenna weight controller 812 inputs the determined antenna weight 812b having a prescribed value to the antenna weight multipliers 52f. Reception signals 7 which have been multiplied by the antenna weight 812b having a prescribed weight at the antenna weight multipliers 52f are input to the antenna signal combining unit 53, and a reception signal 7 obtained through combining among the antennas 51 1 to 51n at the antenna signal combining unit 53 is then output. Hereinafter, such a method of determining an antenna weight 812b and combining weights among the antennas 51 1 to 51n is referred to as \"equal gain combining (EGC) method\". Such the antenna weight controller 812 has the following advantage. Some reception signals 7 that do not have the maximum power may have a high signal power to noise power ratio. Therefore, a higher signal power to noise power ratio can be achieved by combining the reception signals 7 at all of the antennas 51 1 to 51n while multiplying the signals by equal antenna weights 812b. As shown in Fig. 10C, the antenna weight controller 813 comprises a signal power detector 813a. The signal power detector 813a detects the power of reception signals 7 received by the plurality of antennas 51 1 to 51n. As the power of the reception signals 7, the signal power detector 813a detects the power of the reception signals 7 themselves and the power of signals that are obtained by eliminating the effect of noises etc. from the reception signals 7. The antenna weight controller 813 determines weights proportionate to the power of the antennas 51 1 to 51n detected by the signal power detector 813a as antenna weights 813b by which the respective antennas 51 1 to 51n are to be multiplied. The antenna weight controller 813 inputs the antenna weights 813b proportionate to the power of the reception signals 7 at the antennas 51 1 to 51n to the antenna weight multipliers 52f of the respective antennas 51 1 to 51n. The reception signals 7 are input to the antenna signal combining unit 53 after being multiplied by the antenna weights 813b proportionate to the power of the reception signals 7 at the antenna weight multipliers 52f, and a reception signal 7 obtained through combining among the antennas 51 1 to 51n at the antenna signal combining unit 53 is then output. Hereinafter, such a method of determining antenna weights and combining reception signals 7 among the antennas 51 1 to 51n is referred to as \"maximum ratio combining (MRC) method\". Such the antenna weight controller 813 has the following advantage. It makes it possible to reduce the influence of a reception signal 7 having power close to noise power among the reception signals 7, by obtaining a reception signal 7 through combining among the antennas 51 1 to 51n, and to increase the influence of a reception signal 7 having high power, by obtaining a reception signal 7 through combining among the antennas 51 1 to 51n. Thus, a greater signal power to noise power ratio can be achieved. The antenna weight controller 81 may detect data about reception signals 7 such as the power of reception signals 7, to determine antenna weights as seen in the case where the antenna weight controller 811 employing the selective combining method or the antenna weight controller 813 employing MRC is used as the antenna weight controller 81. Such data on reception signals 7 required for determining antenna weights is hereinafter referred to as \"antenna weight data\". Antenna weight data includes the power of reception signals 7 themselves, the power of the reception signals 7 after eliminating the effect of noises etc. and after eliminating guard intervals, and the SNR, SIR, and carrier to interference power ratio (CIR) of the signals. As shown in Fig. 8, the antenna weight controller 81 of the receiver 5 acquires antenna weight data from reception signals 7 from which guard intervals have been deleted by the guard interval deleting unit 52b and which have not been subjected to the time/frequency converting process by the time/frequency converters 52c. Thus, the antenna weight controller 81 is only required to acquire antenna weight data from a single reception signal 7 that has not yet been demultiplexed by time/frequency converter 52c into reception signals 7 on respective sub-carriers of each of the antennas 51 1 to 51n. Therefore, the process at the antenna weight controller 81 can be simplified. The antenna weight controller 81 may acquire antenna weight data from a reception signal 7 which has not been demultiplexed by the time/frequency converter 52c into reception signals 7 on respective sub-carriers and which has not been multiplied using spreading codes yet at the spreading code multiplier 52f. In a receiver 205 shown in Fig. 11, an antenna weight controller 81 may acquire antenna weight data from reception signals 7 which have been multiplied using spreading codes at spreading code multipliers 52e and which have not been multiplied by antenna weights at antenna weight multipliers 52f. The receiver 205 is substantially the same as the receiver 5 shown in Fig. 8 except that the weight controller 81 acquires data on reception signals 7 in a different position. Therefore, symbols like those in the receiver 5 are shown in Fig. 11 to avoid repeated description. In the receiver 205, the antenna weight controller 81 may acquire antenna weight data from reception signals 7 which have been multiplied using spreading codes to eliminate the influence of multiplication of spreading codes at the transmitter 4. When the antenna weight controller 81 is to determine antenna weights based on antenna weight data that is free from the influence of the multiplication of spreading codes at the transmitter 4, if antenna weight data is acquired from reception signals 7 which have not been multiplied using spreading codes yet, a process will be required to obtain antenna weight data after the signals are multiplied using spreading codes based on the antenna weight data. Such a process is not required in the receiver 205, and the process performed by the antenna weight controller 81 can be simplified. A method of determining sub-carrier weights at the sub-carrier weight controller 82 will now be described with reference to Figs. 12A to 12D. The sub-carrier weight controller 82 determines sub-carrier weights using methods such as orthogonal restore combining (ORC), maximum ratio combining (MRC), equal gain combining (EGC), and minimum means square error combining(MMSEC). ORC is a method in which the inverse number of a propagation path variation value 9 of a reception signal 7 on each sub-carrier is determined as a sub-carrier weight 821c by which the reception signal 7 on the sub-carrier is to be multiplied, as shown in Fig. 12A. A propagation path variation value is the value of the power of a reception signal 7 that is a transmission signal 6 transmitted by the transmitter 4 whose phase and amplitude have changed as a result of propagation of the same in the propagation path between the transmitter 4 and the receiver 5. ORC is advantageous in that the reception signals 7 have a constant propagation path variation value 9 after they are multiplied by sub-carrier weights and in that spreading codes for the plurality of data channels #1 to #n are orthogonal to each other. MRC is a method in which a propagation path variation value 9 of a reception signal 7 on each sub-carrier is determined as a sub-carrier weight 822b by which the reception signal 7 on the sub-carrier is to be multiplied, as shown in Fig. 12B. When MRC is employed, a sub-carrier having a small SNR is multiplied by a small sub-carrier weight, and a sub-carrier having a great SNR is multiplied by a great sub-carrier weight. This is advantageous in that the SNR of data symbols obtained by combining the reception signal 7 on each sub-carrier can be maximized. EGC is a method in which a sub-carrier weight 823b having a prescribed value is used for reception signals on all sub-carriers regardless of propagation path variation value 9, as shown in Fig. 12C. When EGC is employed, reception signals 7 on all sub-carriers are multiplied by equal sub-carrier weights. This is advantageous in that the signal power to noise power ratio of data symbols obtained by combining the reception signal 7 on each sub-carrier can be improved and the spreading codes for the plurality of data channels #1 to #n can be kept orthogonal to each other. MMSEC is a method in which sub-carrier weights 824d are determined to minimize a mean square error between a reception signal 7 obtained by multiplying reception signals 7 using spreading codes and combining them over the spreading code duration to despread the same and a transmission signal 6 which has been actually transmitted by the transmitter 4, as shown in Fig. 12D. When MMSEC is employed, the sub-carrier weights 824d can be calculated in accordance with the condition of propagation paths that change at every moment. This is advantageous in that the condition of propagation paths can be taken into consideration; the SNR of data symbols obtained by combining a reception signal on each sub-carrier can be improved; and spreading codes for the plurality of data channels #1 to #n can be kept orthogonal to each other. Specific sub-carrier weight controllers 82 that execute such methods of determining sub-carrier weights include sub-carrier weight controllers 821 to 828 as shown in Figs. 13A to 13G, for example. As shown in Fig. 13A, the sub-carrier weight controller 821 comprises a propagation path variation detector 821a and an inverse number calculating unit 821b. The propagation path variation detector 821a detects propagation path variation value 9 from a reception signal 7. The inverse number calculating unit 821b calculates the inverse numbers of the propagation path variation value 9 detected by the propagation path variation detector 821a and determines the calculated inverse numbers of the propagation path variation value 9 as sub-carrier weights 821c. Such a sub-carrier weight controller 821 can determine the sub-carrier weights 821c using ORC. As shown in Fig. 13B, the sub-carrier weight controller 822 comprises a propagation path variation detector 822a. The propagation path variation detector 822a detects propagation path variation value 9 from a reception signal 7 and determines the detected propagation path variation value 9 as sub-carrier weights 822b as they are. Such a sub-carrier weight controller 822 can determine the sub-carrier weights 822b using MRC. As shown in Fig. 13C, the sub-carrier weight controller 823 comprises a weight storage unit 823a. The weight storage unit 823a stores a weight having a prescribed value. The sub-carrier weight controller 823 acquires the weight having a prescribed value from the weight storage unit 823a and determines the weight having a prescribed value as a sub-carrier weight 823b that is equally used for reception signals 7 on all sub-carriers. Such a sub-carrier weight controller 823 can determine the sub-carrier weight 823b using EGC. A sub-carrier weight controller 824 shown in Fig. 12D comprises an error estimator 824a, a reference symbol storage unit 824b, and a weight calculating unit 824c. The reference symbol storage unit 824b stores a reference symbol. The reference symbol is a symbol whose amplitude and phase are known to the transmitter 4 and the receiver 5. The reference symbol used here is identical to the pilot symbols that the transmitter 4 is to transmit. The error estimator 824a acquires pilot symbols 72 after despreading that are included in a reception signal 7 that have been transmitted by the transmitter 4 and actually received by the receiver 5. The error estimator 824a acquires the reference symbol from the reference symbol storage unit 824b. The error estimator 824a then compares the phases and amplitudes of the pilot symbols 72 and the reference symbol to obtain errors between pilot symbols that have been transmitted by the transmitter 4 and the pilot symbols 72 after despreading that have been actually received and. The error estimator 824a assumes that errors between the pilot symbols 72 after despreading thus obtained and the pilot symbols transmitted by the transmitter 4 are errors between the reception signal 7 after despreading and the transmission signal 6. The error estimator 824a inputs estimated error values between the reception signal 7 after despreading and the transmission signal 6 to the weight calculating unit 824c. The weight calculating unit 824c calculates mean square errors from the estimated error values between the reception signal 7 after despreading and the transmission signal 6 and calculates sub-carrier weight 824d that yields the minimum mean square error. When a reception signal 7 is first received, the weight calculating unit 824c sets the sub-carrier weights at preset initial values because there is no pilot symbol 72 after despreading required for estimating error. Such a sub-carrier weight controller 824 makes it possible to determine sub-carrier weights 824d using MMSEC. The use of received pilot symbols 72 and a reference symbol makes it possible to determine optimum sub-carrier weights 824d by obtaining errors between a reception signal 7 after dispreading and a transmission signal 6 taking the condition of the actual propagation paths into consideration. A sub-carrier weight controller 825 shown in Fig. 13D comprises an error estimator 825a, a bit string storage unit 825b, a reference symbol generating unit 825c, and a weight calculating unit 825d. The bit string storage unit 825b stores a bit string that is a basis of a reference symbol whose amplitude and phase are known to the transmitter 4 and the receiver 5. The bit string storage unit 825b stores bit strings that are bases of pilot symbols that the transmitter 4 is to transmit. The reference symbol generating unit 825c acquires the bit string from the bit string storage unit 825b and modulates the bit string to generate a reference symbol. That is, the reference symbol generating unit 825c modulates the bit string to generate a reference symbol identical to the pilot symbols to be transmitted by the transmitter 4. The error estimator 825a is substantially similar to the error estimator 824a shown in Fig. 12D except that it acquires the reference symbol from the reference symbol generating unit 825c. The weight calculating unit 825d is substantially similar to the weight calculating unit 824c shown in Fig. 12D. Such a sub-carrier weight controller 825 makes it possible to determine sub-carrier weights 825e using MMSEC. The use of received pilot symbols 72 and a reference symbol thus generated makes it possible to determine optimum sub-carrier weights 825e by obtaining errors between a reception signal 7 after despreading and a transmission signal 6 taking the condition of the actual propagation paths into consideration. A sub-carrier weight controller 826 shown in Fig. 13E comprises a channel estimator 826a, a noise power estimator 826b, a number of multiplexed codes estimator 826c, and a weight calculating unit 826d. The channel estimator 826a, noise power estimator 826b, and the number of multiplexed codes estimator 826c store a symbol that is identical to pilot symbols to be transmitted by the transmitter 4 as a reference symbol. The channel estimator 826a, noise power estimator 826b, and the number of multiplexed codes estimator 826c may store a signal that is identical to pilot signals to be transmitted by the transmitter 4 as a reference signal. The channel estimator 826a acquires pilot symbols 72 included in a reception signal 7 which has been transmitted by the transmitter 4 and which has actually been received by the receiver 5. The channel estimator 826a compares the phases and amplitudes of the acquired pilot symbols 72 and the reference symbol to obtain propagation path variations of the pilot symbols 72. The channel estimator 826a performs channel estimation using the propagation path variations of the pilot symbols 72 to obtain channel estimates. The channel estimator 826a may obtain a channel estimated value by comparing pilot signals included in the reception signal 7 and a reference signal. The noise power estimator 826b acquires the pilot symbols 72 included in the reception signal 7 which has been transmitted by the transmitter 4 and which has been actually received by the receiver 5. The noise power estimator 826b compares the acquired pilot symbols 72 and the reference symbol to obtain variance of the pilot symbols 72. The noise power estimator 826b estimates the noise power per sub-carrier of the reception signal 7 using the obtained variance. The noise power estimator 826b may compare the pilot signals included in the reception signal 7 and the reference signal to obtain variance of the pilot signals. The number of multiplexed codes estimator 826c acquires the pilot symbols 72 and data symbols 71 included in the reception signal 7 which has been transmitted by the transmitter 4 and which has been actually received by the receiver 5. The number of multiplexed codes estimator 826c calculates the ratio between the power of the pilot symbols 72 and the power of the data symbols 71. The number of multiplexed codes estimator 826c estimates the number of multiplexed codes from the calculated ratio between the power of the pilot symbols 72 and the power of the data symbols 71. The spreading codes are generated in a quantity corresponding to the number of data channels #1 to #n. Therefore, the number of multiplexed codes corresponds to the number of data channels #1 to #n that are code-division-multiplexed. Therefore, the number of multiplexed codes estimator 826c may estimate the number of multiplexed codes based on the pilot signals and data signals included in the reception signal 7. The channel estimator 826a, noise power estimator 826b, and the number of multiplexed codes estimator 826c respectively input a channel estimated value, an estimated value of noise power, and an estimated value of the number of multiplexed codes to the weight calculating unit 826d. The weight calculating unit 826d substitutes the channel estimated value, the estimated value of noise power, and the estimated value of the number of multiplexed codes of the reception signal 7 in Equation 1 shown below to calculate sub-carrier weights 826e. Equation 1 is an equation for calculating sub-carrier weights 826e that yield a minimum mean square error between a reception signal 7 obtained by multiplying reception signals 7 using spreading codes to despread the same and a transmission signal 6 actually transmitted by the transmitter 4. In Equation 1, w m represents sub-carrier weight; h m represents channel estimated value; N represents noise power; and C mux represents the number of multiplexed codes. m represents the number of sub-carriers. For example, a method of calculating a sub-carrier weight is described in Design and Performance of Multicarrier CDMA System in Frequency-Selective Rayleigh Fading Channels (S. Hara et al., IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON VEHICULAR TECHNOLOGY, pp 1584-1595, VOL. 48, N. 5, September 1999). w m = h m /(C mux |h m | 2 + N) Such a sub-carrier weight controller 824 can obtain sub-carrier weight 826e using MMSEC. Since actually received pilot symbols 72 and data symbols 71 and a reference symbol are used, the sub-carrier weight controller 824 can obtain channel estimated value, noise power, and the number of multiplexed codes taking the actual condition of the propagation paths into consideration, which makes it possible to obtain optimum sub-carrier weight 826e. A sub-carrier weight controller 827 shown in Fig. 13F comprises an error estimator 827a, a reference symbol storage unit 827b, and a weight updating unit 827c. The error estimator 827a and the reference symbol storage unit 827b are substantially similar to the error estimator 824a and the reference symbol storage unit 824b shown in Fig. 12D. The weight updating unit 827c substitutes estimated errors between a reception signal 7 after despreading and a transmission signal 6 in an adaptive algorithm. The weight updating unit 827c executes the adaptive algorithm to obtain sub-carrier weight 827d that are gradually updated. The adaptive algorithm is an algorithm for gradually updating the sub-carrier weight 827d based on the estimated errors between the reception signal 7 after despreading and the transmission signal 6 such that the mean square errors of the errors is minimized. For example, least mean square (LMS) or recursive least squares (RLS) algorithm may be used as the adaptive algorithm. For example, adaptive algorithm is described in orthogonal multi-carrier techniques applied to direct sequence CDMA systems (A. Chouly et al., 1993 IEEE Global Telecommunications Conference). When a reception signal 7 is first received, the weight updating unit 827c sets the sub-carrier weights 827d at preset initial values because there is no despread pilot symbol required for estimating an error. Such a sub-carrier weight controller 824 makes it possible to determine sub-carrier weights 827d using MMSEC. The use of received pilot symbols 72 and a reference symbol allows the weight updating unit 827c to determine optimum sub-carrier weights 827d by obtaining errors between a reception signal 7 after despreading and a transmission signal 6 taking the condition of the actual propagation paths into consideration. Further, the weight updating unit 827c can gradually update the sub-carrier weights 827d to minimize mean square errors between the reception signal 7 after despreading and the transmission signal 6 using the adaptive algorithm. A sub-carrier weight controller 828 shown in Fig. 13G comprises an error estimator 828a, a bit string storage unit 828b, a reference symbol generating unit 828c, and a weight updating unit 828d. The error estimator 828a, bit string storage unit 828b, and reference symbol generating unit 828c are substantially similar to the error estimator 825a, bit string storage unit 825b, and reference symbol generating unit 825c shown in Fig. 13D. The weight updating unit 828d is substantially similar to the weight updating unit 827c shown in Fig. 13F. Such a sub-carrier weight controller 828 makes it possible to determine sub-carrier weight 828e using MMSEC. The use of pilot symbols 72 received by the receiver 5 and a generated reference symbol allows the sub-carrier weight controller 828 to determine optimum sub-carrier weights 828e by obtaining errors between a reception signal 7 after despreading and a transmission signal 6 taking the condition of the actual propagation paths into consideration. Further, the sub-carrier weight controller 828 can gradually update the sub-carrier weight 828e such that a mean square error between the reception signal 7 after despreading and the transmission signal 6 is minimized using the adaptive algorithm. In estimating errors between a reception signal 7 after despreading and a transmission signal 6, the error estimators 824a, 825a, 827a, and 828a shown in Figs. 12D, 13D, 13F, and 13G may obtain errors between pilot symbols 72 and data symbols 71 after despreading, i.e., errors between the reception signal 7 after despreading itself and a reference signal and may assume the errors to be errors between the reception signal 7 after despreading and the transmission signal 6. As a result, the weight calculating units 824c and 825d and the weight updating units 827c and 828d can use estimated errors between an actually received reception signal 7 after despreading and a transmission signal 6 to obtain more appropriate sub-carrier weights 824d, 825e, 827d, and 828e. In this case, a determination feedback part is provided to allow the error estimators 824a, 825a, 827a, and 828a to acquire a reference signal. The determination feedback part acquires a reception signal 7 combined over the spreading code duration of the spreading codes at the symbol combining unit 55. The determination feedback part determines the properties of the transmission signal 6 based on the reception signal 7 and inputs the same to the error estimators 824a, 825a, 827a, and 828a. The error estimators 824a, 825a, 827a, and 828a use the transmission signal 6 as determined by the determination feedback part as a reference signal. The sub-carrier weight controller 82 may obtain sub-carrier weights by detecting data about a reception signal 7 such as the propagation path variation value 9 of the reception signal 7, the phases and amplitudes of the pilot symbols 72 or pilot signals, and the power of the data symbols 71 or data signals as seen in the case wherein the sub-carrier weight controller 821 using ORC, the sub-carrier weight controller 822 using MRC, or any of the sub-carrier weight controllers 824 to 828 using the MMSEC are used as the sub-carrier weight controller 82. Such data about a reception signal 7 required for determining sub-carrier weight is hereinafter referred to as \"sub-carrier weight data\". The sub-carrier weight data includes the propagation path variation value 9 of the reception signal 7, the phases and amplitudes of the pilot symbols 72 or pilot signals, and the power of the data symbols 71 or data signals itself, and data including the propagation path variation value 9 of the reception signal 7, the phases and amplitudes of the pilot symbols 72 or pilot signals, and the power of the data symbols 71 or data signals after the influence of noises and guard intervals are deleted from the reception signal 7. As shown in Fig. 8, the sub-carrier weight controller 82 of the receiver 5 acquires sub-carrier weight data from a reception signal 7 which has been obtained by combining reception signals 7 multiplied by antenna weights at the antenna signal combining unit 53 among the antennas and which has not yet been multiplied by sub-carrier weights at the sub-carrier weight multiplier 54. Thus, the sub-carrier weight controller 82 may acquire sub-carrier weight data from the reception signal 7 obtained through combining performed between the plurality of antennas at the antenna signal combining unit 53. Therefore, the sub-carrier weight controller 82 is not required to acquire the sub-carrier weight data from the signal processing units 52 1 to 52n of the plurality of antennas 51 1 to 51n, thus allowing simplified processing. Further, the sub-carrier weight controller 82 may acquire sub-carrier weight data from a reception signal 7 which has been multiplied by antenna weight and which has been obtained through combining performed between the plurality of antennas. Thus, the sub-carrier weight controller 82 can obtain sub-carrier weight in consideration to the influence of the multiplication of the antenna weight on the reception signal 7 and the influence of the combining among the antennas on the reception signal 7. In addition, since the sub-carrier weight controller 82 acquires the sub-carrier weight data from the reception signal 7 which has been multiplied using spreading codes in this case, it can obtain more appropriate sub-carrier weights using data on the reception signal 7 which is free from the influence of the spreading codes multiplied at the transmitter 4. The sub-carrier weight controller 82 may acquire sub-carrier weight data from reception signals 7 which have been multiplied by antenna weights at the antenna weight multipliers 52f and which have not been combined among the antennas into a reception signal at the antenna signal combining unit 53 yet. Thus, the sub-carrier weight controller 82 can acquire sub-carrier weight data from a reception signal 7 that has been multiplied by antenna weight and can therefore obtain sub-carrier weights in consideration of the influence of the multiplication of the antenna weights on the reception signal 7. In this case, the sub-carrier weight controller 82 may estimate sub-carrier weight data after combining among the antennas based on the sub-carrier weight data acquired from the reception signals 7 which have been multiplied by antenna weights at the antenna weight multipliers 52f and which have not yet been combined among the antennas into a reception signal at the antenna signal combining unit 53. The sub-carrier weight controller 82 may obtain sub-carrier weights from the estimated data. Further, in those cases, since the sub-carrier weight controller 82 acquires the sub-carrier weight data from the reception signal 7 that has been multiplied using spreading codes, more appropriate sub-carrier weights can be obtained using data on the reception signal 7 that is free from the influence of the spreading codes multiplied at the transmitter 4. The sub-carrier weight controller 82 may acquire sub-carrier weight data from reception signals 7 located between the time/frequency converter 52c and the spreading code multipliers 52e or reception signals 7 located between the spreading code multipliers 52e and the antenna weight multipliers 52f. When any of the sub-carrier weight controllers 824, 825, 827, and 828 shown in Figs. 12D, 13D, 13F, and 13G are used as the sub-carrier weight controller 82, sub-carrier weight must be obtained using pilot symbols 72 after despreading or a reception signal 7 after despreading. Therefore, in those cases, the sub-carrier weight controller 82 preferably acquires sub-carrier weight data from a reception signal 7 that has been despread by the symbol combining units 55. In this case, since the sub-carrier weight controller 82 can use the acquired sub-carrier weight data as it is, the process can be simplified. When the sub-carrier weight controller 826 shown in Fig. 13E is used as the sub-carrier weight controller 82, sub-carrier weight data is preferably acquired from a reception signal 7 that is demultiplexed into each sub-carrier as shown in Fig. 9. The sub-carrier weight controller 82 preferably determines a sub-carrier weight based on the reception signal 7 on each sub-carrier. Thus, the channel estimator 826a, noise power estimator 826b, and the number of multiplexed codes estimator 826c can obtain a channel estimated value, an estimated value of noise power, and an estimated value of the number of multiplexed codes for each sub-carrier, respectively. When the antenna weight controller 81 and the sub-carrier weight controller 82 acquire antenna weight data and sub-carrier weight data, respectively, in different positions as described above, the antenna weight controller 81 and the sub-carrier weight controller 82 can acquire the data in the optimum positions for determining antenna weights and sub-carrier weights respectively, which makes it possible to perform control with high accuracy. The weight controller 8 may acquire common data on a reception signal 7 from one location as antenna weight data and sub-carrier data to allow the antenna weight controller 81 and the sub-carrier weight controller 82 to use common data. In this case, the weight controller 8 can acquire the antenna weight data and sub-carrier weight data at a time. Thus, the process at the weight controller 8 can be simplified. The configuration of the receiver 5 is also simplified. In the receivers 5 and 205 shown in Figs. 9 and 11, the antenna weight multipliers 52f multiply the reception signal 7 of each of the antennas 51 1 to 51n by the antenna weights; the antenna signal combining unit 53 performs antenna diversity combining to combine the reception signals 7 multiplied by antenna weights among the antennas; the sub-carrier weight multipliers 54 thereafter multiply the reception signals 7 which have been multiplied using spreading codes on each of the sub-carriers by the sub-carrier weights; and the symbol combining units 55 perform despreading to combine the reception signals 7 multiplied by the sub-carrier weights over the spreading code duration of the spreading codes. In this case, the sub-carrier weight controller 82 determines whether to maintain a state of the reception signals 7 multiplied by the antenna weights or to adjust the state of the reception signals multiplied by the antenna weight again, based on the antenna weight by which the reception signals 7 are first multiplied. The sub-carrier weight controller 82 preferably adjusts the sub-carrier weights based on a result of determination. In this case, the antenna weight controller 81 preferably determines the antenna weight by using the EGC method, and the sub-carrier weight controller 82 preferably determines the sub-carrier weight by using either the MMSEC method or the EGC method. (Method of Communication) A method of communication will now be described. First, a description will be made for the transmission of a transmission signal using the transmitter 4 shown in Fig. 3. As shown in Fig. 14, the transmitter 4 generates a data symbol to be transmitted over each of the data channels #1 to #n (S101). The transmitter 4 performs error-correction-encoding on the generated data symbol (S102). The transmitter 4 performs a data modulating process on the data symbol that has been subjected to error-correction-encoding (S103). The transmitter 4 performs serial/parallel conversion on the data symbol that have been subjected to the data modulating process to divide the data symbol into a plurality of data symbols (S104). Next, the transmitter 4 copies the plurality of data symbols obtained through serial/parallel conversion and dividing to provide a copy of the same in a quantity equal to the number of spreading code duration of spreading codes corresponding to the data channels #1 to #n over which the data symbols are transmitted (S105). The transmitter 4 generates the spreading code corresponding to each of the data channels that are assigned to the data channel. The transmitter 4 then multiplies the copied data symbols using the spreading codes corresponding to the data channels #1 to #n for transmitting the data symbols (S106) to obtain data signals. Next, the transmitter 4 inserts pilot signals in the data signals (S107). The transmitter 4 combines the data signal and pilot signal in each of the data channels #1 to #n to perform code-division-multiplexing (S108). The transmitter 4 spreads the code-division-multiplexed data signals over a plurality of sub-carriers having different frequencies of transmitting data signals (S109). Specifically, the transmitter 4 generates a multi-carrier CDMA signal by performing frequency/time signal conversion on the data signals to assign the data signals to the plurality of sub-carriers having different frequencies. The transmitter 4 inserts guard intervals between each of the data signals spread among the plurality of sub-carriers (S110). Then, the transmitter 4 transmits the multi-carrier CDMA signal having the guard intervals inserted into the receiver 5 as a transmission signal 6 (S111). A description will be made for the reception of a reception signal using the receiver 5 shown in Fig. 8. As shown in Fig. 15, the plurality of antennas 51 1 to 51n of the receiver 5 receive a multi-carrier CDMA signal which is a signal obtained by multiplying a plurality of data symbols transmitted by the transmitter 4 and transmitted over the plurality of data channels #1 to #n using spreading codes for the respective data channels and which is transmitted by the plurality of sub-carriers having different frequencies (S201). The receiver 5 detects symbol timing for each of the reception signals 7 received by the antennas 51 1 to 51n (S202). The receiver 5 deletes guard intervals inserted in the reception signals 7 (S203). Next, the receiver 5 performs time/frequency conversion on the reception signals 7 to demultiplex the reception signals 7 spread over the plurality of sub-carriers having different frequencies into a reception signal 7 on each of the sub-carriers (S204). Then, the receiver 5 generates spreading codes identical to the spreading codes by which the reception signals 7 have been multiplied. The receiver 5 multiplies the reception signals 7 received by the plurality of antennas 51 1 to 51n using spreading codes for the data channels associated with the reception signals 7 (S205). Next, the receiver 5 determines antenna weight and multiplies the reception signal 7 of each of the antennas 51 1 to 51n by an antenna weight thus determined (S206). The receiver 5 combines the reception signals 7 among the antennas 51 1 to 51n (S207). Thus, antenna diversity combining is performed. The receiver 5 determines sub-carrier weight and multiplies the reception signal on each of the sub-carriers by a sub-carrier weight thus determined (S208). The receiver 5 combines the reception signals 7 over the spreading code duration of the spreading codes (S209). Despreading is thus performed. Thus, data symbols are recovered to their states before the multiplication using spreading codes at the transmitter 4. Next, the receiver 5 performs parallel/serial conversion on the data symbols recovered through the combining over the spreading code duration (S210). The receiver 5 performs a data demodulating processing on the parallel/serial converted data symbols (S211). The receiver 5 performs error-correction-decoding processing on the data symbols that have been subjected to the data demodulating processing (S212). Finally, the receiver 5 recovers the data symbols that have been subjected to the error-correction-decoding processing to a state in which they can be output to an output apparatus such as a display or speaker and outputs them to the output apparatus (S213). The following advantages can be provided by the communication system 1, receivers 5 and 205, and method of communication as thus described. In the receiver 5 or 205, the plurality of antennas 51 1 to 51n receive a transmission signals 6 which are signal obtained by multiplying a plurality of data symbols using the spreading codes for each of the data channels #1 to #n and which are transmitted over a plurality of sub-carriers having different frequencies. The spreading code generating unit 52d generates spreading codes for the data channels corresponding to resultant reception signals 7. The spreading code multipliers 52e multiply the reception signals 7 using the spreading codes. The weight controller 8 adjusts antenna weights and sub-carrier weights such that the spreading codes for the plurality of data channels #1 to #n are orthogonal to each other. The antenna weight multipliers 52f and the sub-carrier weight multipliers 54 multiply the reception signals 7 by the antenna weights and sub-carrier weights adjusted by the weight controller 8. Finally, the antenna signal combining unit 53 and symbol combining units 55 combine the reception signals 7 multiplied by the antenna weights and sub-carrier weights among the antennas and over the spreading code duration of the spreading codes. The reception signals 7 are thus multiplied by the antenna weights and sub-carrier weights which have been adjusted by the weight controller 8 such that the spreading codes for the plurality of data channels #1 to #n are orthogonal to each other. Therefore, the spreading codes for the data channels #1 to #n by which the reception signals 7 are multiplied are orthogonal to each other. As a result, data symbols obtained by the receiver 5 or 205 are less affected by interference between the data channels #1 to #n caused by the destruction of orthogonality between the spreading codes. Thus, antenna diversity combining can be appropriately applied in the multi-carrier CDMA transmission method in the receivers 5 and 205. Consequently, a high signal power to noise power ratio can be achieved for the reception signal 7 on each sub-carrier in the receivers 5 and 205, which makes it possible to achieve improved signal transmission characteristics. The weight controller 8 comprises the antenna weight controller 81 and the sub-carrier weight controller 82. The weight controller 8 adjusts antenna weights and the sub-carrier weights and determines antenna weights and sub-carrier weights separately. The receiver 5 comprises the antenna weight multipliers 52f configured to multiply the reception signal 7 at each antenna by an antenna weights, and the sub-carrier weight multipliers 54 configured to multiply the reception signal 7 on each of the sub-carrier by sub-carrier weights. Further, there is provided the antenna signal combining unit 53 configured to combine the reception signals among the antennas and the symbol combining units 55 configured to combine the reception signals 7 over the spreading code duration of the spreading codes. Therefore, the receiver 5 can separately perform a process of determining antenna weights, multiplying the reception signal 7 at each antenna by an antenna weight, and combining the reception signals 7 among the antennas and a process of determining sub-carrier weight, multiplying the reception signal 7 on each sub-carrier by a sub-carrier weight, and combining the reception signals 7 over the spreading code duration of the spreading codes. As a result, the antenna weight controller 81 can determine antenna weight in consideration to the process of multiplying the reception signals 7 by sub-carrier weight and combining them over the spreading code duration, and the sub-carrier weight controller 82 can determine sub-carrier weight in consideration to the process of multiplying the reception signals 7 by antenna weight and combining them among the antennas 51 1 to 51n. After the antenna weight multipliers 52f multiply the reception signal 7 at each antenna by the antenna weights and the antenna signal combining unit 53 performs antenna diversity combining by combining the reception signals 7 among the antennas, the sub-carrier weight multipliers 54 multiply the reception signal 7 on each of the sub-carriers by the sub-carrier weights, the signal 7 having been multiplied using the spreading code. After the antenna diversity combining is performed, the symbol combining units 55 perform despreading by combining the reception signals 7 that have been multiplied by the sub-carrier weights over the spreading code duration of the spreading codes. Therefore, the sub-carrier weight multipliers 54 and the symbol combining units 55 are not required to perform the process of multiplying each of the reception signals 7 at the plurality of antennas 51 1 to 51n by the sub-carrier weight and the process of combining the reception signals 7 over the spreading code duration of the spreading codes separately. That is, the sub-carrier weight multipliers 54 and the symbol combining units 55 can perform the sub-carrier multiplying process and the process of combining the reception signals 7 over the spreading code duration of the spreading codes on a reception signal 7 obtained through combining between the plurality of antennas 51 1 to 51n on a collective basis. [Second Embodiment] A description will now be made on a communication system and a method of communication according to a second embodiment of the invention. The communication system of the second embodiment has a receiver 305 as shown in Fig. 16. (Receiver) As shown in Fig. 16, the receiver 305 comprises a plurality of antennas 51 1 to 51n, a plurality of signal processing units 352 1 to 352n, a weight controller 308, an antenna signal symbol combining unit 353, a serial/parallel converter 56, a data demodulator 57, an error-correction-decoder 58, and a data symbol recovering unit 59. The signal processing units 352 1 to 352n have a symbol timing detector 52a, a guard interval deleting unit 52b, a time/frequency converter 52c, a spreading code generating unit 52d, a plurality of spreading code multipliers 52e, and a plurality of collective weight multipliers 352f. The plurality of antennas 51 1 to 51n, the serial/parallel converter 56, the data demodulator 57, the error-correction-decoder 58, the data symbol recovering unit 59, the symbol timing detector 52a, the guard interval deleting unit 52b, the time/frequency converter 52c, the spreading code generating unit 52d, and the spreading code multipliers 52e are substantially similar to those in the receiver 5 shown in Fig. 8. Therefore, they are indicated by like symbols in Fig. 16 and will not be described here. After a transmission signal 6 is received by the plurality of antennas 51 1 to 51n, processing similar to that for the receiver 5 shown in Fig. 8 is performed up to the multiplication of reception signals 7 using spreading codes at the spreading code multipliers 52e. The spreading code multipliers 52e input the reception signals 7 to the collective weight multipliers 352f after multiplying them using spreading codes. The weight controller 308 adjusts antenna weights and sub-carrier weights such that the spreading codes for the plurality of data channels #1 to #n are orthogonal to each other and determines weights by which the reception signal 7 on each sub-carrier at each antenna is to be collectively multiplied (hereinafter referred to as \"collective weight\"). The weight controller 308 preferably determines the collective weights by adjusting the antenna weight and sub-carrier weight such that the spreading codes for the plurality of data channels #1 to #n are orthogonal to each other and such that a great SNR is achieved. Thus, the receiver 305 can obtain a reception signal 7 with a great signal power to noise ratio thus achieving improved signal transmission characteristics. The weight controller 308 determines collective weights by adjusting antenna weights using the selective combining method, EGC method, or the MRC etc. and adjusting sub-carrier weights using ORC, MRC, EGC, or MMSEC etc. The weight controller 308 comprises the configuration of any of the antenna weight controllers 811 to 813 shown in Figs. 10A, 10B, and 10C and the configuration of any of the sub-carrier weight controllers 821 to 828 shown in Fig. 12D and Figs. 13A to 13G. The weight controller 308 directly determines collective weights by adjusting antenna weight and sub-carrier weight. A weight controller 408 as shown in Fig. 17 may be used as the weight controller for determining the collective weight. The weight controller 408 has an antenna weight controller 481, a sub-carrier weight controller 482, and a collective weight controller 483. The antenna weight controller 481 determines antenna weight. The sub-carrier weight controller 482 determines sub-carrier weight. The antenna weight controller 481 determines antenna weight using the selective combining method, EGC method, or MRC method etc. as described above. For example, the antenna weight controllers 811 to 813 shown in Figs. 10A, 10B, and 10C may be used as the antenna weight controller 481. The sub-carrier weight controller 482 determines sub-carrier weight using ORC, MRC, EGC, or MMSEC etc. as described above. For example, the sub-carrier weight controllers 821 to 828 shown in Fig. 12D and Figs. 13A to 13G may be used as the sub-carrier weight controller 482. The antenna weight controller 481 and the sub-carrier weight controller 482 input determined antenna weight and sub-carrier weight to the collective weight controller 483. The collective weight controller 483 adjusts the antenna weight determined by the antenna weight controller 481 and the sub-carrier weight determined by the sub-carrier weight controller 482 to determine collective weight 484. Thus, the weight controller 408 determines antenna weight and sub-carrier weight separately and then determines the collective weights 484 based on them. The collective weight multipliers 352f multiply collectively the reception signal 7 on each of the sub-carrier of each of the antennas 51 1 to 51n by the collective weights adjusted by the weight controller 308 or 408. The collective weight multipliers 352f multiply reception signals 7 received by the antennas 51 1 to 51n for processing by the signal processing units 352 1 to 352n by collective weights. The collective weight multipliers 352f are provided in a quantity equal to the number of sub-carriers. Each of the collective weight multipliers 352f multiply the reception signal 7 on each sub-carrier input from the respective spreading code multiplier 52e by the collective weight. The collective weight multiplier 352f of each of the signal processing units 352 1 to 352n inputs the reception signal 7 multiplied by the collective weight to the antenna signal symbol combining unit 353. The antenna signal symbol combining unit 353 is a combining unit for collectively combining the reception signal 7 multiplied by the collective weights among the antennas 51 1 to 51n and over the spreading code duration of the spreading codes. The antenna signal symbol combining unit 353 collectively combines the reception signals 7 input from the collective weight multiplier 352f of each of the signal processing units 352 1 to 352n among the antennas 51 1 to 51n and over the spreading code duration of the spreading codes for the data channels #1 to #n associated with the reception signals. Thus, diversity combining and despreading is collectively performed. In the receiver 305, the spreading code multipliers 52e multiply the reception signal 7 on each sub-carrier using the spreading codes for the data channels #1 to #n associated with the reception signal 7, and the collective weight multipliers 352f thereafter collectively multiply the reception signal 7 on each sub-carrier of each of the antennas 51 1 to 51n by the collective weight. The antenna signal symbol combining unit 353 collectively combines the reception signals 7 among the antennas 51 1 to 51n and over the spreading code duration of the dispreading codes. As a result of combining at the antenna signal symbol combining unit 353, data symbols are recovered to their states before the multiplication of spreading codes at the transmitter. A reception signal 7 obtained as a result of combining at the antenna signal symbol combining unit 353 is input to the serial/parallel converter 56. Thereafter, processing similar to in the receiver 5 shown in Fig. 8 is performed to output data symbols. The weight controllers 308 and 408 acquire antenna weight data and sub-carrier weight data from reception signals 7 when the selective combining method, maximum ratio combining method, ORC, MRC, or MMSEC is used. As shown in Fig. 16, the weight controllers 308 and 408 collectively acquire antenna weight data and sub-carrier weight data from reception signals 7 which have been multiplied using spreading codes at the spreading code multipliers 52e and which have not yet been multiplied by collective weights at the collective weight multipliers 352f. This simplifies the processing performed by the weight controllers 308 and 408. Further, the weight controllers 308 and 408 may acquire antenna weight data and sub-carrier weight data from reception signals 7 which have been multiplied using spreading codes to eliminate the influence of multiplication of the same using spreading codes at the transmitter. Thus, the weight controllers 308 and 408 can obtain appropriate collective weights. The weight controllers 308 and 408 may acquire antenna weight data and sub-carrier weight data from reception signals 7 located between the time/frequency converter 52c and the spreading code multipliers 52e. The weight controllers 308 and 408 may acquire antenna weight data and sub-carrier weight data from reception signals 7 from which guard intervals have been deleted by the guard interval deleting units 52b and which have not yet been subjected to time/frequency conversion at the time/frequency converter 52c. This allows the weight controllers 308 and 408 to acquire antenna weight data and sub-carrier weight data from a single reception signal 7 of each of the antennas 51 1 to 51n before the signal is demultiplexed into a reception signal 7 on each sub-carrier by the time/frequency converter 52c, and the processes performed by the weight controllers 308 and 408 are thereby simplified. The weight controllers 308 and 408 may adjust sub-carrier weights to determine collective weights using pilot symbols 72 after despreading or a reception signal 7 after despreading as done by the sub-carrier weight controllers 824, 825, 827, and 828 shown in Figs. 12D, 13D, 13F, and 13G. In such cases, the weight controllers 308 and 408 preferably acquire sub-carrier weight data from a reception signal 7 that has been despread by the antenna signal symbol combining unit 353. This makes it possible to simplify the process at the sub-carrier weight controller 82 because the acquired sub-carrier weight data can be used as it is. The weight controllers 308 and 408 may adjust sub-carrier weights to determine collective weights as done by the sub-carrier weight controller 826 shown in Fig. 13E. In this case, the weight controllers 308 and 408 preferably acquire sub-carrier weight data from a reception signal 7 which has been demultiplexed on a sub-carrier-by-sub-carrier bases. This allows the channel estimator 826a, the noise power estimator 826b, and the number of multiplexed codes estimator 826c to respectively obtain a channel estimate value, an estimated value of noise power, and an estimated value of the number of multiplexed codes for each sub-carrier. The weight controllers 308 and 408 may acquire antenna weight data and sub-carrier weight data from different positions. This allows the weight controllers 308 and 408 to acquire data for determining antenna weights and sub-carrier weights in optimum positions, which allows highly accurate control. (Method of Communication) A description will now be made for the reception of a reception signal using the receiver 305 shown in Fig. 16. As shown in Fig. 18, the receiver 305 performs steps S301 to S305. Steps S301 to S305 are substantially similar to steps S201 to S205 shown in Fig. 15. Next, the receiver 305 determines collective weight and collectively multiplies a reception signal 7 on each sub-carrier of each of the antennas 51 1 to 51n by a collective weight thus determined (S306). The receiver 305 collectively combines the reception signals 7 multiplied by the collective weight among the antennas 51 1 to 51n and over the spreading code duration of spreading codes (S307). Thus, antenna diversity combining and despreading is performed on a collective basis. Thus, data symbols are recovered to their states before being multiplied using spreading codes at the transmitter. Next, the receiver 305 performs steps S308 to S311 as shown in Fig. 18. Steps S308 to S311 are substantially similar to steps S210 to S213 shown in Fig. 15. The following advantages can be provided by the communication system, the receiver 305, and the method of communication described above. The weight controller 308 adjusts antenna weight and sub-carrier weight such that the spreading codes for the plurality of data channels #1 to #n are orthogonal to each other and determines the collective weight by which the reception signals 7 are to be collectively multiplied. The collective weight multipliers 352f multiply the reception signal 7 on each of the sub-carriers of each of the antennas 51 1 to 51n by the collective weight. The antenna signal symbol combining unit 353 collectively combines the reception signals 7 multiplied by the collective weights among the antennas 51 1 to 51n and over the spreading code duration of the spreading codes. Therefore, the reception signals 7 are multiplied by the collective weight which have been adjusted such that the spreading codes for the plurality of data channels #1 to #n are orthogonal to each other at the weight controller 308. Thus, the spreading codes for the respective data channels #1 to #n by which the reception signals 7 are multiplied are orthogonal to each other. As a result, data symbols obtained by the receiver 305 are less affected by interference between the data channels #1 to #n caused by the destruction of orthogonality between the spreading codes. In the receiver 305, antenna diversity combining can be thus appropriately applied in the multi-carrier CDMA transmission method. As a result, a great signal power to noise power ratio can be achieved for a reception signal 7 on each sub-carrier in the receiver 305,thus providing improved signal transmission characteristics. Further, the receiver 305 can collectively perform the process of determining collective weights, the process of performing multiplication by the collective weights, and the process of combing reception signals. This allows the processing performed by the receiver 305 to be simplified. The configuration of the receiver 305 can also kept simple. [Third Embodiment] A description will now be made for a communication system and a method of communication according to a third embodiment of the invention. The communication system of the third embodiment has a receiver 505 as shown in Fig. 19. (Receiver) As shown in Fig. 19, the receiver 505 comprises a plurality of antennas 51 1 to 51n, a plurality of signal processing units 552 1 to 552n, a weight controller 508, a plurality of antenna weight multipliers 553, an antenna signal combining unit 554, a serial/parallel converter 56, a data demodulator 57, an error-correction-decoder 58, and a data symbol recovering unit 59. The signal processing units 552 1 to 552n have a symbol timing detector 52a, a guard interval deleting unit 52b, a time/frequency converter 52c, a spreading code generating unit 52d, a plurality of spreading codes multipliers 52e, a plurality of sub-carrier weight multipliers 552f, and a plurality of symbol combining units 552g. The plurality of antennas 51 1 to 51n, the serial/parallel converter 56, the data demodulator 57, the error-correction-decoder 58, the data symbol recovering unit 59, the symbol timing detector 52a, the guard interval deleting unit 52b, the time/frequency converter 52c, the spreading code generating unit 52d, and the spreading code multipliers 52e are substantially similar to those in the receiver 5 shown in Fig. 8. Therefore, they are indicated by like symbols in Fig. 19 and will not be described here. After a transmission signal 6 is received by the plurality of antennas 51 1 to 51n, processing similar to that for the receiver 5 shown in Fig. 8 is performed up to the multiplication of reception signals 7 using spreading codes at the spreading code multipliers 52e. The spreading code multipliers 52e input the reception signals 7 to the sub-carrier weight multipliers 552f after multiplying them using spreading codes. The weight controller 508 comprises an antenna weight controller 581 and a sub-carrier weight controller 582. The weight controller 508 adjusts antenna weight and sub-carrier weight such that the spreading codes for the plurality of data channels #1 to #n are orthogonal to each other. The weight controller 508 preferably adjusts antenna weight and sub-carrier weight such that the spreading codes for the plurality of data channels #1 to #n are orthogonal to each other and such that a great signal power to noise power ratio is achieved. The weight controller 508 adjusts antenna weight and sub-carrier weight and determines antenna weight and sub-carrier weight separately. The antenna weight controller 581 determines antenna weight using the selective combining method, EGC method, or MRC method etc. The antenna weight controllers 811 to 813 shown in Figs. 10A, 10B, and 10C may be used as the antenna weight controller 581. The sub-carrier weight controller 582 determines sub-carrier weight using ORC, MRC, EGC, or MMSEC etc. The sub-carrier weight controllers 821 to 828 shown in Fig. 12D and Figs. 13A to 13G may be used as the sub-carrier weight controller 582. The sub-carrier weight multipliers 552f of the respective signal processing units 552 1 to 552n multiply reception signals 7 on respective sub-carriers received by the antennas 51 1 to 51n to be processed by the signal processing units 552 1 to 552n by sub-carrier weights. The sub-carrier weight multipliers 552f are provided in a quantity equal to the number of sub-carriers. The respective sub-carrier weight multipliers 552f multiply the reception signals 7 on the respective sub-carriers input from the respective spreading code multipliers 52e by the sub-carrier weights. Each of the sub-carrier weight multipliers 552f inputs the reception signal 7 on the respective sub-carriers multiplied by the sub-carrier weight to the symbol combining units 552g. The symbol combining units 552g of the respective signal processing units 552 1 to 552n combine the reception signals 7 on the respective sub-carriers received by the antennas 51 1 to 51n to be processed by the signal processing units 552 1 to 552n over the spreading code duration of the spreading codes for the data channels #1 to #n associated with the reception signals 7. The symbol combining units 552g combine the reception signals 7 on the respective sub-carriers multiplied by the sub-carrier weights and input from the sub-carrier weight multipliers 552f over the spreading code duration. Despreading is thus performed. The symbol combining units 552g input a reception signal 7 obtained through the combining to antenna weight multipliers 553. The antenna weight multipliers 553 multiply the reception signals 7 after despreading input from the symbol combining units 552g of the respective signal processing units 552 1 to 552n by antenna weights. The antenna weight multipliers 553 are provided in a quantity equal to the number of symbol combining units 552g of all of signal processing units 552 1 to 552n. The respective antenna weight multipliers 553 input the reception signals 7 multiplied by the antenna weights to the antenna signal combining unit 554. The antenna signal combining unit 554 combines the reception signals 7 input from the antenna weight multipliers 553 among the antennas 51 1 to 51n. Antenna diversity combining is thus performed. In the receiver 505, the spreading code multipliers 52e multiply the reception signals 7 on the respective sub-carriers using the spreading codes, and the sub-carrier weight multipliers 552f multiply the reception signals 7 on the respective sub-carriers by sub-carrier weights. Next, the symbol combining units 552g combine the reception signals 7 multiplied by the sub-carrier weights over the spreading code duration of the spreading codes to despread the same. Data symbols are recovered to their states before multiplication using spreading codes at the transmitter 4. Thereafter, the antenna weight multipliers 553 multiply the reception signals 7 at the respective antennas 51 1 to 51n, which have been combined over the spreading code duration by the antenna weights. The antenna signal combining unit 554 performs antenna diversity combining to combine the reception signals 7 which have been multiplied by the antenna weights after being despread among the antennas 51 1 to 51n. The reception signal 7 combined by the antenna signal combining unit 554 is input to the serial/parallel converter 56. Thereafter, processing similar to that for the receiver 5 shown in Fig. 8 is performed to output data symbols. In the receiver 305 shown in Fig. 19, the sub-carrier weight multipliers 552f multiply the reception signals 7 which have been multiplied using the spreading codes on each of the sub-carriers by the sub-carrier weights; the symbol combining units 552g performs despreading to combine the reception signals 7 multiplied by the sub-carrier weights over the spreading code duration of the spreading codes; the antenna weight multipliers 553 thereafter multiply the reception signals 7 of each of the antennas 51 1 to 51n by the antenna weights ; and the antenna signal combining unit 554 performs antenna diversity combining to combine the reception signals 7 among the antennas. In this case, the antenna weight controller 581 determines to whether maintain a state of the reception signals multiplied by the sub-carrier weights or to adjust the state of the reception signals again, based on the sub-carrier weights by which the reception signals 7 are first multiplied. The antenna weight controller 581 preferably adjusts the antenna weights based on a result of determination. In this case, the sub-carrier weight controller 582 preferably determines the sub-carrier weights by using the MMSEC method, and the antenna weight controller 581 preferably determines the antenna weights by using the EGC method. The weight controller 508 acquires antenna weight data and sub-carrier weight data form reception signals 7 when the selective combining method, maximum ratio combining method, ORC, MRC, or MMSEC is used. As shown in Fig. 19, the antenna weight controller 581 acquires antenna weight data from reception signal 7 at each antenna that has been combined over the spreading code duration by the symbol combining units 552g. The antenna weight controller 581 determines the antenna weight based on the reception signal 7 at each antenna, which has been combined by the symbol combining units 552g over the spreading code duration. Thus, the antenna weight controller 581 can determine the antenna weights in consideration to the influence of interference between the data channels on the reception signal 7 which has actually been multiplied by the sub-carrier weights and combined over the spreading code duration. This makes it possible to reduce the influence of interference between the data channels on data symbols more appropriately and to achieve higher transmission characteristics. The antenna weight controller 581 may acquire antenna weight data from reception signals 7 which have been multiplied by sub-carrier weights by the sub-carrier weight multipliers 552f and which have not yet been combined by the symbol combining units 552g. This eliminates the influence of multiplication using spreading codes at the transmitter and makes it possible to determine antenna weights based on antenna weight data after the multiplication by the sub-carrier weights. Therefore, the antenna weight controller 582 can determine the antenna weights in consideration for the influence of multiplication of the reception signals 7 by the sub-carrier weights, and more appropriate antenna weights can be obtained because reception signals 7 free from the influence of multiplication using spreading codes are used. The antenna weight controller 581 may acquire antenna weight data from reception signals 7 which have been multiplied using spreading codes at the spreading code multipliers 52e and which have not yet been multiplied by sub-carrier weights at the sub-carrier weight multipliers 552f, reception signals 7 from which guard intervals have been deleted by the guard interval deleting units 52b and which have not yet been subjected to a time/frequency conversion process at the time/frequency converters 52c, or reception signals 7 which have been demultiplexed into reception signals 7 on the respective sub-carriers by the time/frequency converters 52c and which have not yet been multiplied using spreading codes at the spreading code multipliers 52e. As shown in Fig. 19, the sub-carrier weight controller 582 acquires sub-carrier weight data from reception signals 7 which have been multiplied using spreading codes at the spreading code multipliers 52e and which have not been multiplied by sub-carrier weights at the sub-carrier weight multipliers 552f. Thus, the sub-carrier weight controller 582 can determine more appropriate antenna weights based on sub-carrier data acquired from the reception signals 7 from which the influence of multiplication using spreading codes at the transmitter 4 has been eliminated. The sub-carrier weight controller 582 may acquire sub-carrier eight data between the time/frequency converters 52c and the spreading code multipliers 52e. When any of the sub-carrier weight controller 824, 825, 827, and 828 shown in Figs. 12D, 13D, 13F, and 13G are used as the sub-carrier weight controller 582, sub-carrier weight data is acquired from reception signals 7 which have been despread by the symbol combining units 552g. Thus, the processing at the sub-carrier weight controller 582 can be simplified because it can use the acquired sub-carrier data as it is. When the sub-carrier weight controller 826 shown in Fig. 13E is used as the sub-carrier weight controller 582, sub-carrier weight data is preferably acquired from reception signals 7 which have been demultiplexed on a sub-carrier-by-sub-carrier basis. The sub-carrier weight controller 582 then preferably determines sub-carrier weights based on the reception signal 7 on each sub-carrier. Thus, the channel estimator 826a, noise power estimator 826b, and the number of multiplexed codes estimator 826c can obtain a channel estimate, an estimated value of noise power, and an estimated value of the number of multiplexed codes , respectively, on a sub-carrier-by-sub-carrier basis. (Method of Communication) A description will now be made on reception of a reception signal using the receiver 505 shown in Fig. 19. As shown in Fig. 19, the receiver 505 performs steps S401 to S405. Steps S401 to S405 are substantially similar to steps S201 to S205 shown in Fig. 15. Next, the receiver 505 determines sub-carrier weights and multiplies a reception signal 7 on each sub-carrier received by the antennas 51 1 to 51n by a sub-carrier weight thus determined (S406). Then, the receiver 505 combines the reception signals 7 over the spreading code duration of spreading codes (S407). Despreading is thus performed. Thus, data symbols are recovered to their states from before multiplication using the spreading codes at the transmitter. Next, the receiver 505 determines antenna weights and multiplies the reception signal 7 of each of the antennas 51 1 to 51n by an antenna weight thus determined. Then, the receiver 505 combines the reception signals 7 among the antennas 51 1 to 51n. Thus, antenna diversity combining is performed (S409). Next, the receiver 505 performs steps S410 to S413 as shown in Fig. 20. The steps S410 to S413 are substantially similar to steps S210 to S213 shown in Fig. 15. Such a communication system, receiver 505, and method of communication can provide advantages substantially similar to those achieved by the communication system 1, receiver 5, and method of communication shown in Figs. 2, 8, and 15. Further, the antenna weight multipliers 553 multiply the reception signals 7 of each of the antennas 51 1 to 51n by the antenna weights after the spreading code multipliers 52e multiply the reception signals 7 using the spreading codes for the data channels #1 to #n corresponding to the reception signals 7; the sub-carrier weight multipliers 552f multiply the reception signals 7 on each of the sub-carriers by sub-carrier weights; and the symbol combining units 552g performs despreading by combining the reception signals 7 multiplied by the sub-carrier weights over the spreading code duration of the spreading codes. The antenna signal combining unit 554 performs antenna diversity combining by combining the reception signals 7 multiplied by the antenna weights among the antennas after the dispreading is performed. Therefore, the antenna weight controller 581 can determine antenna weights in consideration of the influence of interference between the data channels on the reception signals 7 which have been multiplied using the spreading codes, multiplied by the sub-carrier weights, and combined over the spreading code duration of the spreading codes, i.e., the reception signals 7 which have been despread. Then, the antenna weight multipliers 553 multiply the signals by the antenna weights. Finally, the antenna signal combining unit 554 combines the reception signals 7 which have been multiplied by the antenna weights determined in consideration of the influence of interference between the data channels #1 to #n among the antennas. Thus, the receiver 505 can adequately reduce the influence of interference between the data channels on data symbols, thus achieving improved signal transmission characteristics. [Fourth Embodiment] A description will now be made for a communication system and a method of communication according to a fourth embodiment of the invention. The communication system of the fourth embodiment has a receiver 605 as shown in Fig. 21. (Receiver) As shown in Fig. 21, the receiver 605 has a plurality of antennas 51 1 to 51n, a plurality of signal processing units 652 1 to 652n, a weight controller 608, antenna signal combining unit 653, a time/frequency converter 654, a spreading code generating unit 655, a plurality of spreading code multipliers 656, a plurality of sub-carrier weight multipliers 657, a plurality of symbol combining units 658, a serial/parallel converter 56, a data demodulator 57, an error-correction-decoder 58, and a data symbol recovering unit 59. The signal processing units 652 1 to 652n have a symbol timing detector 52a, a guard interval deleting unit 52b, and an antenna weight multiplier 652c. The plurality of antennas 51 1 to 51n, the serial/parallel converter 56, the data demodulator 57, the error-correction-decoder 58, the data symbol recovering unit 59, the symbol timing detector 52a, and the guard interval deleting unit 52b are substantially similar to those of the receiver 5 shown in Fig. 8. Therefore, they are indicated by like reference numerals in Fig. 21 and will not be described here. After a transmission signal 6 is received by the plurality of antennas 51 1 to 51n, processes similar to those in the receiver 5 shown in Fig. 8 are performed up to the removal of guard intervals from reception signals 7 at the guard interval deleting unit 52b. The weight controller 608 has an antenna weight controller 681 and a sub-carrier weight controller 682. The weight controller 508 adjusts antenna weights and sub-carrier weights such that the spreading codes for the plurality of data channels #1 to #n are orthogonal to each other. The weight controller 608 preferably adjusts antenna weights and sub-carrier weights such that the spreading codes for the plurality of data channels #1 to #n are orthogonal to each other and such that a great SNR is achieved. The weight controller 608 adjusts antenna weights and sub-carrier weights and determines antenna weights and sub-carrier weights separately. The antenna weight controller 681 determines antenna weights using the selective combining method, the EGC method, or the maximum ratio combining method. The antenna weight controllers 811 to 813 shown in Figs. 10A, 10B, and 10C may be used as the antenna weight controller 681. The sub-carrier weight controller 682 determines sub-carrier weights using ORC, MRC, EGC, or MMSEC. The sub-carrier weight controllers 821 to 828 shown in Fig. 12D and Figs. 13A to 13G may be used as the sub-carrier weight controller 682. The antenna weight controller 681 inputs antenna weights to the antenna weight multipliers 652c of the respective signal processing units 652 1 to 652n. The sub-carrier weight controller 682 inputs sub-carrier weights to the sub-carrier weight multipliers 657. The antenna weight multipliers 652c of each of the signal processing units 652 1 to 652n multiply reception signals 7 received by the antennas to be processed by the signal processing units 652 1 to 652n by the sub-carrier weights. The sub-carrier weight multiplier 652c of each of the antenna signal processing units 652 1 to 652n is required only to multiply one reception signal 7 received by the respective one of the antennas 51 1 to 51n by the antenna weight. Therefore, it is necessary to provide only one such unit in each of the signal processing units 652 1 to 652n. The configuration of the signal processing units 652 1 to 652n is thus simplified. The antenna weight multiplier 652c of each of the signal processing units 652 1 to 652n inputs the reception signal 7 multiplied by the antenna weight to the antenna signal combining unit 653. The antenna signal combining unit 653 combines the reception signals 7 input from the antenna weight multipliers 652c of each of the signal processing units 652 1 to 652n among the antennas 51 1 to 51n. Antenna diversity combining is thus performed. The antenna signal combining unit 653 inputs the reception signals 7 combined among the antennas 51 1 to 51n to the time/frequency converter 654. The time/frequency converter 654 performs time/frequency conversion on the reception signals 7 after combining among the antennas 51 1 to 51n input from the antenna signal combining unit 653 to demultiplex them into a reception signal 7 on each of the sub-carriers. The time/frequency converter 654 inputs the reception signals 7 demultiplexed on a sub-carrier-by-sub-carrier basis to the spreading code multipliers 656. The spreading code generating unit 655 generates spreading codes similar to the spreading codes by which the reception signals have been multiplied. The spreading code generating unit 655 inputs the generated spreading codes to the spreading code multipliers 656. The spreading code multipliers 656 multiply the reception signal 7 on each sub-carrier after the combining among the antennas 51 1 to 51n which has been demultiplexed by the time/frequency converter 654 using the spreading codes of the data channels #1 to #n over which the reception signal 7 has been transmitted in the direction of the frequency axis. By thus multiplying the reception signal 7 using the spreading codes, the influence of the multiplication using the spreading codes at the transmitter is eliminated from the signal. The spreading code multipliers 656 are provided in a quantity equal to the number of the sub-carriers. Each of the spreading code multipliers 656 multiplies the reception signal 7 on the respective sub-carrier after the combining among the antennas 51 1 to 51n by a spreading code. The spreading code multipliers 656 inputs the reception signals 7 multiplied using the spreading codes to the sub-carrier weight multipliers 657. The sub-carrier weight multiplier 657 multiplies the reception signal 7 on each sub-carrier input from the respective spreading code multipliers 52e by a sub-carrier weight. The sub-carrier weight multipliers 657 are provided in a quantity equal to the number of sub-carriers. Each of the sub-carrier weight multipliers 657 inputs the reception signal 7 on each sub-carrier multiplied by the sub-carrier weight to the symbol combining units 658. The symbol combining units 658 combine the reception signal 7 on each sub-carrier after the combining among the antennas input from the sub-carrier weight multiplier 657 over the spreading code duration of the spreading codes for the data channels #1 to #n associated with the reception signal 7. Despreading is thus performed. In the receiver 605, the antenna weight multipliers 652c of the respective signal processing units 652 1 to 652n multiply the reception signals 7 by the antenna weights, and the antenna signal combining unit 653 combines them among the antennas 51 1 to 51n. Then, the time/frequency converter 654 demultiplex the reception signals 7 after the combining among the antennas into a reception signal on each sub-carrier. The spreading code multipliers 656 multiply the reception signal 7 on each sub-carrier after the combining among the antennas 51 1 to 51n using the spreading codes. Finally, the sub-carrier weight multipliers 657 multiply the reception signals 7 on the respective sub-carriers after the combining among the antennas 51 1 to 51n by the sub-carrier weights, and the symbol combining units 658 combine them over the spreading code duration of the spreading codes. Despreading is thus performed. As a result of the combining at the symbol combining units 658, data symbols are recovered to their states before the multiplication using spreading codes at the transmitter. The reception signal 7 combined by the symbol combining units 658 is input to the serial/parallel converter 56. Thereafter, processes similar to those in the receiver 5 shown in Fig. 8 are performed to output data symbols. In the receiver 605 shown in Fig. 21, the antenna weight multipliers 652c multiply the reception signals 7 of each of the antennas 51 1 to 51n by the antenna weights; the antenna signal combining units 653 perform antenna diversity combining to combine the reception signals 7 multiplied by the antenna weights among the antennas; the sub-carrier weight multipliers 657 thereafter multiply the reception signals 7 which have been multiplied by the spreading codes on each of the sub-carriers by the sub-carrier weights; and the symbol combining units 658 perform despreading to combine the reception signals 7 multiplied by the sub-carrier weights over the spreading code duration of the spreading codes. In this case, the sub-carrier weight controller 682 determines to whether maintain the state of the reception signals 7 multiplied by the antenna weights or to adjust the state of the reception signals multiplied by the antenna weights again, based on the antenna weights by which the reception signals 7 are first multiplied. The sub-carrier weight controller 682 preferably adjusts the sub-carrier weights based on a result of determination. In this case, the antenna weight controller 681 preferably determines the antenna weights by using the EGC method, and the sub-carrier weight controller 682 preferably determines the sub-carrier weights by using either the MMSEC method or EGC method. The weight controller 608 acquires antenna weight data and sub-carrier weight data from reception signals 7 when the selective combining method, maximum ratio combining method, ORC, MRC, or MMSEC is used. As shown in Fig. 21, the antenna weight controller 681 acquires antenna weight data from a reception signal 7 from which guard intervals have been deleted by the guard interval deleting unit 52b and which has not been multiplied by an antenna weight at the antenna weight multiplier 652c yet. The sub-carrier weight controller 682 determines sub-carrier weights based on reception signals 7 which have been combined among the antennas 51 1 to 51n at the antenna signal combining unit 653, demultiplexed into a reception signal on each sub-carrier at the time/frequency converter 654, and multiplied using spreading codes at the spreading code multipliers 656 and which have not been multiplied by sub-carrier weights at the sub-carrier weight multipliers 657 yet. Thus, the sub-carrier weight controller 682 can determine the sub-carrier weights in consideration to the influence of the multiplication of the reception signals 7 by the antenna weights and combining of them among the antennas 51 1 to 51n. Further, the sub-carrier weight controller 682 can use sub-carrier weight data acquired from reception signals 7 from which the influence of the multiplication using spreading codes at the transmitter has been eliminated. Therefore, more appropriate sub-carrier weights can be obtained. The sub-carrier weight controller 682 may acquire sub-carrier weight data from reception signals 7 which have been demultiplexed into a reception signal on each sub-carrier at the time/frequency converter 654 and which have not been multiplied using spreading codes at the spreading code multipliers 656 yet. When any of the sub-carrier weight controllers 824, 825, 827, and 828 shown in Figs. 12D, 13D, 13F, and 13G are used as the sub-carrier weight controller 682, sub-carrier weight data is acquired from reception signals 7 which have been despread by the symbol combining units 658. This makes it possible to simplify the process at the sub-carrier weight controller 682 because it can use sub-carrier weight data thus acquired as it is. When the sub-carrier weight controller 826 shown in Fig. 13E is used as the sub-carrier weight controller 682, sub-carrier weight data is preferably acquired from reception signals 7 demultiplexed on a sub-carrier-by-sub-carrier basis. The sub-carrier weight controller 682 preferably determines a sub-carrier weight based on the reception signal 7 on each sub-carrier. This allows the channel estimator 826a, the noise power estimator 826b, and the number of multiplexed codes estimator 826c can obtain a channel estimate, an estimated value of noise power, and an estimated value of the number of multiplexed codes respectively for each sub-carrier. In the receiver 605, the time/frequency converter 654 may be provided downstream of the antenna weight multiplier 652c in each of the signal processing units 652 1 to 652n. In this case, the time/frequency converters of the respective signal processing units 652 1 to 652n input reception signals 7 demultilexed on a sub-carrier-by-sub-carrier basis to the antenna signal combining unit 653. In such a configuration, an antenna weight multiplier 652c is only required to multiply one reception signal 7 received by the respective one of the antennas 51 1 to 51n, and it is required to provide only one such unit in each of the signal processing units 652 1 to 652n. This allows the configuration of the signal processing units 652 1 to 652n to be simplified. (Method of Communication) A description will now be made on reception of a reception signal using the receiver 605 shown in Fig. 21. As shown in Fig. 22, the receiver 605 performs steps S501 to S503. Steps S501 to S503 are substantially similar to steps S201 to S203 shown in Fig. 15. Next, the receiver 605 determines antenna weights and multiplies a reception signal 7 of each of the antennas 51 1 to 51n by the antenna weight thus determined (S504). Then, the receiver 605 combines the reception signals 7 among the antennas 51 1 to 51n (S505). Antenna diversity combining is thus performed. Next, the receiver 605 performs time/frequency conversion on the reception signals 7 to demultiplex the reception signals 7 spread among a plurality of sub-carriers having different frequencies into reception signals on a sub-carrier-by-sub-carrier basis (S506). The receiver 605 generates spreading codes similar to the spreading codes by which the reception signals 7 have been multiplied. Then, the receiver 605 multiplies the reception signals 7 received by the plurality of antennas 511 to 51n using the spreading codes for the data channels associated with the reception signals 7 (S507). Next, the receiver 605 determines sub-carrier weights and multiplies the reception signal on each sub-carrier by the determined sub-carrier weights (S508). The receiver 605 then combines the reception signals 7 over the spreading code duration of the spreading codes (S509). Despreading is thus performed. Data symbols are thus recovered to their states before the multiplication of the spreading codes at the transmitter. Next, the receiver 605 performs steps S510 to S513 as shown in Fig. 22. Steps S510 to S513 are substantially similar to steps S210 to S213 shown in Fig. 15. Such a communication system, receiver 605, and method of communication can provide advantages substantially similar to those achieved by the communication system 1, receiver 5, and method of communication shown in Figs. 2, 8, and 15. Further, the antenna weight multipliers 652c multiply the reception signals 7 of each of the antennas 51 1 to 51n by antenna weight before the reception signals 7 are demultiplexed by the time/frequency converters 654 into a reception signal on each of the sub-carriers, and the antenna signal combining unit 653 combines the reception signals 7 multiplied by the antenna weight among the antennas 51 1 to 51n. Thereafter, the time/frequency converter 654 demultiplexes them into the reception signal on each of the sub-carriers. The sub-carrier weight multipliers 657 multiply the reception signals 7 on the respective sub-carriers by sub-carrier weights. Finally, the symbol combining units 658 combine the reception signals 7 multiplied by the sub-carrier weights over the spreading code duration of spreading codes. Therefore, the time/frequency converter 654, the sub-carrier weight multipliers 657, and the symbol combining units 658 are not required to perform the process of demultiplexing reception signals 7 into a reception signal 7 on each sub-carrier, the process of multiplying them by sub-carrier weights, and the process of combining the reception signals 7 over the spreading code duration of the spreading codes separately on each of signals received by the plurality of antennas 51 1 to 51n. That is, the time/frequency converter 654, the sub-carrier weight multipliers 657, and the symbol combining units 658 can perform the process of demultiplexing reception signals 7 into a reception signal 7 on each sub-carrier, the process of multiplying them by sub-carrier weights, and the process of combining the reception signals 7 over the spreading code duration of the spreading codes on a reception signal 7 obtained through combining between the plurality of antennas 51 1 to 51n collectively. [Fifth Embodiment] A communication system according to a fifth embodiment of the invention will now be described. The communication according to the fifth embodiment of the invention has a transmitter 404 as shown in Fig. 23 or a transmitter 504 as shown in Fig. 25. (Transmitter) As shown in Fig. 23, the transmitter 404 has a plurality of signal processing units 441 1 to 441n, a signal combining unit 442, a frequency/time converter 43, a guard interval inserting unit 44, and an antenna 45. The signal processing units 441 1 to 441n have a data symbol generating unit 41a, an error-correction-encoder 41b, a data modulator 41c, a serial/parallel converter 241d, a spreading code generating unit 41e, a plurality of symbol copiers 241f, a plurality of spreading code multipliers 241g, a propagation path variation estimating pilot symbol inserting unit 441h, a weight updating pilot signal inserting unit 441i, and a data channel signal combining unit 441j. The data symbol generating units 41e, the error-correction-encoders 41b, the data modulators 41c, the spreading code generating units 41e, the frequency/time converter 43, and the guard interval inserting unit 44 are substantially similar to those in the transmitter 4 shown in Fig. 3. The serial/parallel converters 241d, the plurality of symbol copiers 241f and the plurality of spreading code multipliers 241g are substantially similar to those in the transmitter 204 shown in Fig. 5. Therefore, description on them is omitted in Fig. 23. Propagation path variation estimating pilot symbol inserting unit 441h inserts pilot symbols for estimating a propagation path variation into the data symbols. Thus, a transmission signal 6 is generated in which a data signal and a pilot signal for estimating propagation path variations are multiplexed. Symbols whose amplitude and phase are known to a receiver 5 are used as the pilot symbols for estimating a propagation path variation. The pilot symbols for estimating propagation path variation are used by the receiver for estimating a propagation path variation of the reception signal. The weight updating pilot signal inserting unit 441i inserts pilot signals for updating weight into the data signals. Thus, a transmission signal 6 is generated in which a data signal and a pilot signal for updating weights are multiplexed. Symbols whose amplitude and phase are known to the receiver 5 are used as the pilot symbols for updating weights. The pilot signals for updating weights are used by the receiver for estimating errors between a reception signal after despreading and a transmission signal to update sub-carrier weights. Common pilot symbols may be used in the plurality of data channels #1 to #n as the pilot symbols for estimating propagation path variations and the pilot symbols for updating weights, and different pilot symbols may alternatively be used in each of the data channels #1 to #n. The data channel signal combining units 441j combine a data signal, a pilot signal for estimating propagation path variation and a pilot signals for updating weight in each of the data channels #1 to #n. In the transmitter 404, the pilot signal for updating weight and the data signal are multiplexed using code-division multiplexing in which they are multiplexed in the direction of a spreading code axis. In the transmitter 404, the pilot signal for updating weights and data signal which have been code-division-multiplexed are multiplexed with the pilot signal for estimating propagation path variation using time-division-multiplexing in which they are multiplexed in the direction of a time axis. The data symbol generating units 41a through data modulators 41c perform processes similar to those in the transmitter 4 shown in Fig. 3. The data modulators 41c and the propagation path variation estimating pilot symbol inserting unit 441h inputs data symbols and pilot symbols for estimating propagation path variation to the serial/parallel converters 241d at different times. Thus, the data symbols and the pilot symbols for estimating propagation path variations are time-division-multiplexed. Specifically, the data symbols and the pilot symbols for estimating propagation path variations are input to the serial/parallel converters 241d at different times by switching units that switch the input of data symbols from the data modulators 41c to the serial/parallel converters 241d and the input of pilot symbols for estimating propagation path variations from propagation path variation estimating pilot symbol inserting unit 441h to the serial/parallel converters 241d. The serial/parallel converters 241d through spreading code multipliers 241g perform processes similar to those in the receiver 204 shown in Fig. 5 except that the spreading code multipliers 241g multiply the pilot symbols for estimating path variations and the data symbols by different spreading codes. The spreading code multipliers 241g input data signals and pilot signals for estimating propagation path variations which have been multiplied using spreading codes and which have been time-division-multiplexed to the data channel signal combining units 441j. The data channel signal combining units 441j combine the data signals and the pilot signals for estimating propagation path variation to be transmitted over the respective data channels #1 to #n. The data channel signal combining units 441j input the combined data signals and pilot signals for estimating propagation path variation to the signal combining unit 442. The weight updating pilot signal inserting unit 441i inputs pilot signals for updating weights to the signal combining unit 442, the signals being obtained by multiplying the pilot symbols for updating weights by the same spreading codes as those multiplied on the pilot symbols for estimating a propagation path variation at the signal processing units 441 1 to 441n. The signal combining unit 442 multiplex the time-division-multiplexed data signals and pilot signals for estimating propagation path variations input from the data channel signal combining units 441j of the signal processing units 441 1 to 441n of the respective data channels #1 to #n with the pilot signals for estimating propagation path variations input from the data channel signal combining unit 441j on a code-division-multiplex basis. Thereafter, the frequency/time converter 43 through antenna 45 performs processes similar to those in the transmitter 4 shown in Fig. 3. As a result, a transmission signal 6d as shown in Fig. 24 is obtained. In the transmission signal 6d, pilot signals 63d for updating weights and data signals 61d are code-division-multiplexed in the direction of the spreading code axis, and the pilot signals 63d for updating weights and the data signals 61d are multiplexed with pilot signals 62d for estimating propagation path variations on a time-division multiplex basis in the direction of a time axis. The pilot signals 62d for estimating propagation path variations and the pilot signals 63 for updating weights are time-division multiplexed using the same spreading codes. The transmission signal 6d is spread in the direction of a frequency axis to become a multi-carrier CDMA signal. Thus, propagation path variation estimating pilot symbol inserting unit 441h and the weight updating pilot signal inserting unit 441i are separately provided in the transmitter 404. Therefore, the transmitter 404 is capable of separately transmitting optimum pilot symbols for estimating propagation path variations and optimum pilot symbols for updating weights that allow errors between a reception signal after despreading and a transmission signal. Further, the transmitter 404 can generate the transmission signal 6 using a method of multiplexing suitable for each of the pilot symbols. For example, since the pilot signals 63d for updating weights have a long duration as shown in Fig. 24, they will reduce frame efficiency when time-division-multiplexed with the data signals 61d. Therefore, frame efficiency can be improved by using code-division-multiplexing for the pilot signals 63d for updating weights. The pilot signals 62d for estimating propagation path variations have a short duration . Therefore, time-division-multiplexing may be used for the pilot signals 62d for estimating propagation path variations to prevent inter-code interference at the pilot signals 62d for estimating propagation path variations. This makes it possible to improve the accuracy of estimation of propagation path variations performed by a receiver. As seen in a transmitter 504 shown in Fig. 25, in order to time-division-multiplex data signals with pilot signals for estimating propagation path variations and pilot signals for updating weights, the signal processing units 541 1 to 541n of the respective data channels #1 to #n may be provided with a propagation path variation estimating pilot symbol inserting unit 441h to insert pilot symbols for estimating propagation path variation in the serial/parallel converter 241d and a weight updating pilot symbol inserting unit 541i to insert pilot symbols for updating weights in the serial/parallel converter 241d. Further, in order to code-division-multiplex data signals with pilot signals for estimating propagation path variations and pilot signals for updating weights, there may be provided a propagation path variation estimating pilot signal inserting unit 541h to be inserted between pilot symbols for estimating propagation path variations in the signal combining unit 442 and a weight updating pilot signal inserting unit 441i to be inserted between pilot signals for updating weight in the signal combining unit 442. In such a transmitter 504, appropriate methods of multiplexing can be selected and combined to multiplex data signals, pilot signals for updating weights, and pilot signals for estimating propagation path variations. The transmitter 504 is thus capable of generating an optimum transmission signal. (Receiver) When any of the receivers 5, 205, 505, and 605 shown in Figs. 8, 11, 19, and 21 receives a reception signal 7 including pilot symbols for estimating propagation path variations and pilot symbols for updating weights from the transmitter 404 or 504, a sub-carrier weight controller 829 as shown in Fig. 26 may be used as the sub-carrier weight controller 82, 282, 482, 582, or 682. The features of the sub-carrier weight controller 829 may be provided in the weight controller 308 shown in Fig. 16. As shown in Fig. 26, the sub-carrier weight controller 829 has a channel estimator 829a, a noise power estimator 829b, a number of multiplexed codes estimator 829c, a weight calculating unit 829d, an error estimator 829e, a reference symbol storage unit 829, a weight updating unit 829g, and a switching unit 829h. The channel estimator 829a, noise power estimator 829b, and number of multiplexed codes estimator 829c are substantially similar to the channel estimator 826a, noise power estimator 826b, and number of multiplexed codes estimator 826c of the sub-carrier weight controller 826 shown in Fig. 13E except that they use pilot symbols 72a for estimating propagation path variations to estimate respective values of interest. The weight calculating unit 829d is substantially similar to the weight calculating unit 826d shown in Fig. 13 except that it inputs sub-carrier weights determined by the same to the switching unit 829h. The error estimator 829e is substantially similar to the error estimator 827a of the sub-carrier weight controller 827 shown in Fig. 13F except that it uses pilot symbols 72b for updating weights to estimate errors. The reference symbol storage unit 829f holds pilot symbols for updating weights to be transmitted by the transmitter 304 or 404 as reference symbols. The weight updating unit 829g inputs sub-carrier weights determined by the same to the switching unit 829h. The weight updating unit 829g does not determine sub-carrier weights when it first receives a reception signal 7 because there is no pilot symbol after despreading required estimating an error. The weight updating unit 829g is otherwise substantially similar to the weight updating unit 827c of the sub-carrier weight controller 827 shown in Fig. 13F. The switching unit 829h inputs sub-carrier weights input from the weight calculating unit 829d and sub-carrier weights input from the weight updating unit 829g to the sub-carrier weight multipliers 54, 552f, and 657 of the receivers 5, 205, 505, and 605 shown in Figs. 8, 11, 19, and 21 and the collective weight multiplier 352f of the receiver 305 shown in Fig. 16 on a switched basis. When a reception signal 7 is first received, since there is no pilot symbol after despreading required for estimating an error, the switching unit 829h inputs sub-carrier weights determined by the weight calculating unit 829d to the sub-carrier weight multiplier 54, 552f or 657 or the collective weight multiplier 352f as initial values. Thereafter, it inputs sub-carrier weights determined by the weight updating unit 829g to the sub-carrier weight multiplier 54, 552f or 657 or the collective weight multiplier 352f. This makes it possible to multiply the reception signal 7 by more appropriate initial values as sub-carrier weights. The switching unit 829h may be appropriately set to input sub-carrier weights obtained by the weight calculating unit 829d or the weight updating unit 829g to the sub-carrier weight multipliers 54, 552f, or 657 or the collective weight multiplier 352f. Accordingly, the switching system is not restricted to one described above. Such a sub-carrier weight controller 829 makes it possible to obtain a channel estimate, a noise power estimate, and an estimate of the number of multiplexed codes more adequately using pilot symbols for estimating propagation path variations that are optimum for estimating propagation path variations. The sub-carrier weight controller 829 can estimate an error more adequately by using pilot symbols for weight updating that are optimum for estimating an error between a reception signal after despreading and a transmission signal. The sub-carrier weight controller 829 may properly use sub-carrier weights determined by the sub-carrier weight calculating unit 829d or the weight updating unit 829g depending on situations. The sub-carrier weight controllers 824, 825, 827, and 828 can use the pilot symbols 72b for weigh updating, and the sub-carrier weight controller 826 can use the pilot symbols 72a for estimating propagation path variations when any of the sub-carrier weight controller 824 to 828 shown in Figs. 12D and Figs. 13D to 13G is used as any of the sub-carrier weight controller 82, 282, 482, 582, and 682 of the receiver 5, 205, 505, and 605 shown in Figs. 8, 11, 19 and 21 or when the weight controller 382 of the receiver 305 shown in Fig. 16 has the features of any of the sub-carrier weight controllers 824 to 828. The communication system and transmitters 404 and 504 thus described can provide advantages substantially similar to those of the communication system 1 and the transmitters 4, 204, and 304 shown in Figs. 2, 3, 5, and 7. Further, since the propagation path variation estimating pilot symbol inserting unit 411h and propagation path variation estimating pilot signal inserting unit 541h are provided separately from the weight updating pilot signal inserting unit 441i and weight updating pilot symbol inserting unit 541i, the transmitters 404 and 505 can transmit the pilot symbols for estimating propagation path variations and the pilot symbols for updating weights separately. Further, the transmitters 404 and 504 can generate a transmission signal 6d using a method of multiplexing suitable for each type of pilot symbols. The receiver can obtain a channel estimate, an estimate of noise power, and an estimate of the number of multiplexed codes using the pilot symbols for estimating propagation path variations more adequately and can more estimate an error using the pilot symbols for updating weights more adequately. [Sixth Embodiment] A description will now be made on a communication system according to a sixth embodiment of the invention. The communication system of the sixth embodiment has a receiver 705 as shown in Fig. 27. (Receiver) receiver 705 has a plurality of antennas 51 1 to 51n, a plurality of signal processing units 752 1 to 752n, a judging unit 752, a configuration switching unit 753, a despreading-after-diversity-combining unit 754, a diversity-combining-after-despreading unit 755, a serial/parallel converter 56, a data demodulator 57, an error-correction-encoder 58, and a data symbol recovering unit 59. The signal processing units 752 1 to 752n have a symbol timing detector 52a, a guard interval deleting unit 52b, and a reception signal condition measuring unit 751. The plurality of antennas 51 1 to 51n, serial/parallel converter 56, data demodulator 57, error-correction-encoder 58, data symbol recovering unit 59, symbol timing detectors 52a, and guard interval deleting units 52b are substantially similar to those in the receiver 5 shown in Fig. 8. Therefore, they are indicated by like reference numerals in Fig. 27 and will not be described here. The reception signal condition measuring units 751 are measuring portions for measuring the state of reception signal 7. The reception signal condition measuring units 751 measures the power and fading correlation of the reception signals 7 as the condition of the reception signal 7. The reception signal condition measuring units 751 are provided in a quantity equal to the number of antennas 51 1 to 51n. In the receiver 705, the signal processing units 752 1 to 752n associated with the antennas 51 1 to 51n have the reception signal condition measuring units 751 configured to measure a condition of the reception signals 7 received by the plurality antennas 51 1 to 51n. The reception signal condition measuring units 751 may measure either power or fading correlation of the reception signals 7, and other parameters indicating the condition of the reception signals 7 may be measured. The reception signal condition measuring units 751 of the signal processing units 752 1 to 752n measure the power and fading correlation factors of the reception signals 7 received by the antennas 51 1 to 51n, respectively. The reception signal condition measuring units 751 input measured values of the power and correlation factors of the reception signals 7 to the judging unit 752. The reception signal condition measuring units 751 of the signal processing units 752 1 to 752n input the reception signals 7 received by the antennas 51 1 to 51n to the configuration switching unit 753. The judging unit 752 controls an order of multiplying a reception signal on each of the sub-carriers that has been multiplied using the spreading codes by the sub-carrier weights, combining the reception signal on each of the sub-carriers over the spreading code duration, multiplying a reception signal of each of the antennas by the antenna weights, and combining the reception signal of each of the antennas among the antennas. The judging unit 752 controls the order of despreading and antenna diversity combining. Specifically, the judging unit 752 controls the order of the process of multiplying a reception signal 7 on each sub-carrier by sub-carrier weights at the sub-carrier weight multiplier and combining the reception signals 7 multiplied by the sub-carrier weights over the spreading code duration of the spreading codes at the symbol combining unit (despreading) and the process of multiplying a reception signal 7 of each of the antennas 51 1 to 51n by antenna weights at the antenna weight multiplier and combining the reception signals 7 multiplied by the antenna weights among the antennas 51 1 to 51n at the antenna signal combining unit (antenna diversity combining). The judging unit 752 controls the order of despreading and antenna diversity combining based on the condition of the reception signals 7 received by the antennas 51 1 to 51n that are input from the reception signal condition measuring units 751 of the signal processing units 752 1 to 752n. The judging unit 752 controls the order based on the measured values of the fading correlation factors of the reception signals 7 at the antennas 51 1 to 51n. Specifically, when the reception signals 7 at the antennas 51 1 to 51n have great fading correlation factors, the judging unit 752 judges that despreading is to follow antenna diversity combining. When the reception signals 7 at the antennas 51 1 to 51n have small fading correlation factors, the judging unit 752 judges that antenna diversity combining is to follow despreading. Thus, when there is high fading correlation that reduces the gain of antenna diversity combining, the accuracy of channel estimation can be improved by performing despreading after antenna diversity combining. Therefore, the sub-carrier weight controller can perform channel estimation with high accuracy even if there is a reduction in the gain of antenna diversity, which makes it possible to determine optimum sub-carrier weights. Thus, the receiver 705 can improve the final signal transmission characteristics. When there is low fading correlation, antenna diversity combining is performed after despreading, which allows the antenna weight controller to determine antenna weights in consideration to the influence of interference between the data channels on the reception signals 7 after despreading, i.e., the influence on the orthogonality of the spreading codes. Thus, the receiver 705 can improve the signal transmission characteristics. The judging unit 752 may control the order based on the measured values of the power of the reception signals 7 at the antennas 51 1 to 51n. Specifically, when the power of the reception signals 7 at the antennas 51 1 to 51n is small, the judging unit 752 judges that despreading is to follow antenna diversity combining. When the reception signals 7 at the antennas 51 1 to 51n have high power, the judging unit 752 judges that antenna diversity combining is to follow despreading. Thus, when the reception signals 7 have low power that reduces the accuracy of channel estimation, the accuracy of channel estimation can be improved by performing despreading after antenna diversity combining. This allows the sub-carrier weight controller to perform channel estimation with high accuracy to determine optimum sub-carrier weights. Thus, the receiver 705 can improve the final signal transmission characteristics. When the power of the reception signals 7 is high, the accuracy of channel estimation is already high. Therefore, antenna diversity combining is performed after despreading to allow the antenna weight controller to determine antenna weights in consideration to the influence of interference between the data channels on the reception signals 7 after despreading, i.e., the influence on the orthogonality of the spreading codes. Thus, the receiver 705 can improve the signal transmission characteristics. The judging unit 752 may control the order of despreading and antenna diversity combining based on both of the fading correlation factors of the reception signals 7 and the power of the reception signals. For example, the judging unit 752 stores a threshold value for the fading correlation factors and a threshold value for power that be used as criteria in determining the order of the despreading and antenna diversity combining. First, the judging unit 752 compares measured values of the fading correlation factors of the reception signals 7 received by the antennas 51 1 to 51n that are input from the reception signal condition measuring unit 751 with the threshold value for fading correlation factors. When the measured values of the fading correlation factors of the reception signals 7 received by the antennas 51 1 to 51n are greater than the threshold value for fading correlation factors, the judging unit 752 judges that despreading is to follow antenna diversity combining. When the measured values of the fading correlation factors of the reception signals 7 received by the antennas 51 1 to 51n that are input from the reception signal condition measuring units 751 are equal to or smaller than the threshold value for fading correlation factors, the judging unit 752 determines to judge the order based on the power of the reception signals 7. When the measured values of the fading correlation factors of the reception signals 7 are equal to or smaller than the threshold value, the judging unit 752 compares measured values of the power of the reception signals 7 received by all of the antennas 51 1 to 51n that are input from the reception signal condition measuring units 751 with the threshold value for power. When the measured values of the power of the reception signals 7 received by all of the antennas 51 1 to 51n are smaller than the threshold for power, the judging unit 752 judges that despreading is to follow antenna diversity combining. When any of the measured values of the power of the reception signals 7 received by all of the antennas 51 1 to 51n that are input from the reception signal condition measuring units 751 is equal to or greater than the threshold value for power, the judging unit 752 judges that antenna diversity combining is to follow despreading. The judging unit 752 inputs the determined order of despreading and antenna diversity combining to the configuration switching unit 753. The configuration switching unit 753 switches input of the reception signals 7. The reception signals 7 received by the antennas 51 1 to 51n are input to the configuration switching unit 753 from the reception signal condition measuring units 751 of the signal processing units 752 1 to 752n. The order of despreading and antenna diversity combining determined by the judging unit 752 is also input to the configuration switching unit 753. Based on the order of despreading and antenna diversity combining input from the judging unit 752, the configuration switching unit 753 inputs the reception signals 7 at the antennas 51 1 to 51n to either of the despreading-after-diversity-combining unit 754 and the diversity-combining-after despreading unit 755. In the case of the order in which antenna diversity combining is to follow despreading, the configuration switching unit 753 inputs the reception signals 7 at the antennas 51 1 to 51n to the diversity-combining-after despreading unit 755, as indicated by the solid line in Fig. 27. In the case of the order in which despreading is to follow antenna diversity combining, the configuration switching unit 753 inputs the reception signals 7 at the antennas 51 1 to 51n to the despreading-after-diversity-combining unit 754, as indicated by the dotted line in Fig. 27. The despreading-after-diversity-combining unit 754 comprises a configuration for performing despreading after antenna diversity combining. The despreading-after-diversity- combining unit 754 comprises a time/frequency converter, a spreading code generating unit, a plurality of spreading code multipliers, a weight controller, a plurality of antenna weight multipliers, an antenna signal combining unit, a plurality of sub-carrier weight multipliers, and a plurality of symbol combining units. The weight controller comprises an antenna weight controller and a sub-carrier weight controller. In the despreading-after-diversity-combining unit 754, those features are arranged to allow despreading to be performed after antenna diversity combining. Specifically, the time/frequency converter, the spreading code generating unit, the plurality of spreading code multipliers, the weight controller, the plurality of antenna weight multipliers, the antenna signal combining unit, the plurality of sub-carrier weight multipliers, and the plurality of symbol combining units may be arranged similarly to those in the receivers 5, 205, and 605 shown in Figs. 8, 11, and 21. When the reception signals 7 at the antennas 51 1 to 51n are input from the configuration switching unit 753 under the control of the judging unit 752, the despreading-after-diversity- combining unit 754 processes the reception signals 7. Specifically, the antenna weight multipliers of the despreading-after-diversity-combining unit 754 multiply the reception signal 7 of each of the antennas 51 1 to 51n by an antenna weight, and the antenna signal combining unit combines the reception signals 7 multiplied by the antenna weights among the antennas 51 1 to 51n to perform antenna diversity combining. Next, the sub-carrier weight multipliers of the despreading-after-diversity- combining unit 754 multiply the reception signal 7 on each sub-carrier multiplied by a spreading code by a sub-carrier weight, and the symbol combining units combine the reception signals multiplied by the sub-carrier weights over the spreading code duration to perform despreading. The despreading-after-diversity- combining unit 754 inputs the combined reception signal to the serial/parallel converter 56. Thereafter, processes similar to those in the receiver 5 shown in Fig. 8 are performed to output data symbols. The diversity-combining-after despreading unit 755 comprises a configuration for performing antenna diversity combining after despreading. The diversity-combining-after despreading unit 755 has a time/frequency converter, a spreading code generating unit, a plurality of spreading code multipliers, a weight controller, a plurality of antenna weight multipliers, an antenna signal combining unit, a plurality of sub-carrier weight multipliers, and a plurality of symbol combining units. The weight controller has an antenna weight controller and a sub-carrier weight controller. In the diversity-combining-after despreading unit 755, these features are arranged to allow antenna diversity combining to be performed after despreading. Specifically, the time/frequency converter, the spreading code generating unit, the plurality of spreading code multipliers, the weight controller, the plurality of antenna weight multipliers, the antenna signal combining unit, the plurality of sub-carrier weight multipliers, and the plurality of symbol combining units may be arranged similarly to those in the receivers 505 shown in Fig. 19. When the reception signals 7 at the antennas 51 1 to 51n are input from the configuration switching unit 753 under the control of the judging unit 752, the diversity-combining-after despreading unit 755 processes the reception signals 7. Specifically, the sub-carrier weight multipliers of the diversity-combining-after despreading unit 755 multiply the reception signal 7 on each sub-carrier multiplied by a spread code by sub-carrier weights, and the symbol combining units combine the reception signals 7 multiplied by the sub-carrier weights over the spreading code duration to perform dispreading. Next, the antenna weight multipliers multiply the reception signal of each of the antennas 51 1 to 51n by antenna weights, and the antenna signal combining unit combines the reception signals 7 multiplied by the antenna weights among the antennas 51 1 to 51n to perform antenna diversity combining. The diversity-combining-after despreading unit 755 inputs the combined reception signal 7 to the serial/parallel converter 56. Thereafter, processes similar to those in the receiver 5 shown in Fig. 8 are performed to output data symbols. While the judging unit 752 controls the order of despreading and antenna diversity combining, this is not limiting the invention. The judging unit 752 may control the order of the processes involved in despreading, i.e., the process of multiplying a reception signal on each sub-carrier multiplied by a spreading code by a sub-carrier weight and combining over the spreading code duration (combining in despreading) and processes involved in antenna diversity combining, i.e., the process of multiplying a reception signal at each antenna by an antenna weight and combining among the antennas (combining in antenna diversity combining)/ (Method of Communication) A description will now be made on reception of a reception signal using the receiver 705 shown in Fig. 27. As shown in Fig. 28, the receiver 705 measures the power and fading correlation factor of each of reception signals 7 received by the antennas 51 1 to 51n (S601). The receiver 705 compares measured values of the fading correlation factors of the reception signals 7 and a threshold value for fading correlation factors that is to be used as a criterion in determining the order of despreading and antenna diversity combining (S602). When the measured values of the fading correlation factors of the reception signals 7 are greater than the threshold value for the fading correlation factors at step S602, the receiver 705 judges that despreading is to follow antenna diversity combining. Then, the receiver 705 performs despreading after antenna diversity combining (S604). When the measured values of the fading correlation factors of the reception signals 7 are equal to or smaller than the threshold value for the fading correlation factors at step S602, the receiver 705 compares measured values of the power of the reception signals 7 received by the antennas 51 1 to 51n with the threshold value for power (s603). When the measured values of the power of the reception signals 7 received by all of the antennas 51 1 to 51n are smaller than the threshold value for power at step S603, the receiver 705 judges that despreading is to follow antenna diversity combining. Then, the receiver 705 performs despreading after antenna diversity combining (S604). When any of the measured values of the power of the reception signals 7 received by all of the antennas 51 1 to 51n is equal to or greater than the threshold value for power at step S603, the receiver 705 judges that antenna diversity combining is to follow despreading. Then, the receiver 705 performs antenna diversity combining after despreading (S605). In the communication system, the receiver 705, and the method of communication as thus described, the judging unit 752 controls the order of despreading and antenna diversity combining based on the condition of the reception signals 7 measured by the reception signal condition measuring units 751. Under the control of the judging unit 752, the configuration switching unit 753 inputs the reception signals 7 from the antennas 51 1 to 51n to the despreading-after-diversity-combining unit 754 and the diversity-combining-after-despreading unit 755. The despreading-after-diversity-combining unit 754 and the diversity-combining-after despreading unit 755 perform dispreading and antenna diversity combining in the order in accordance with the control of the judging unit 752. Thus, the receiver 705 can perform despreading and antenna diversity combining in an adequate order depending on the condition of the reception signals 7 from the antennas 51 1 to 51n. Therefore, the receiver 705 can further improve signal transmission characteristics. [Seventh Embodiment] A description will now be made on a communication system and a method of communication according to a seventh embodiment of the invention. The communication system of the seventh embodiment has a receiver 805 as shown in Fig. 29. (Receiver) As shown in Fig. 29, the receiver 805 has a plurality of antennas 51 1 to 51n, a plurality of signal processing units 852 1 to 852n, a weight controller 808, a plurality of antenna weight multipliers 553, an antenna signal symbol combining unit 554, a serial/parallel converter 56, a data demodulator 57, an error-correction-decoder 58, and a data symbol recovering unit 59. The signal processing units 852 1 to 852n have a symbol timing detector 52a, a guard interval deleting unit 52b, a propagation path state estimator 851, a time/frequency converter 52c, a spreading code generating unit 52d, a plurality of spreading code multipliers 52e, a plurality of sub-carrier weight multipliers 552f, a plurality of symbol combining units 552g, and a signal to interference power ratio estimator 852. The plurality of antennas 51 1 to 51n, the plurality of antenna weight multipliers 553, the antenna signal combining unit 554, the serial/parallel converter 56, the data demodulator 57, the error-correction-decoder 58, the data symbol recovering unit 59, the symbol timing detector 52a, the guard interval deleting unit 52b, the time/frequency converter 52c, the spreading code generating unit 52d, the plurality of spreading code multipliers 52e, the plurality of sub-carrier weight multipliers 552f, and the symbol combining units 552g are substantially similar to those in the receiver 505 shown in Fig. 19. Therefore, they are indicated by like reference numerals in Fig. 29 and will not be described here. After a transmission signal 6 is received by the plurality of antennas 51 1 to 51n, processes similar to those in the receiver 505 shown in Fig. 19 are performed up to the removal of guard interval from reception signals 7 performed by the guard interval deleting units 52b. The propagation path state estimators 851 estimates a propagation path state in which signals transmitted by a transmitter has been propagated or the propagation path state between the transmitter and the receiver 805. The propagation path state estimators 851 estimate delay spread, the number of paths, and the maximum Doppler frequency as a propagation path state. The propagation path state estimators 851 are provided in a quantity equal to the number of the antennas 51 1 to 51n. In the receiver 805, the signal processing units 852 1 to 852n associated with the antennas 511 to 51n have propagation path state estimators 851 for estimating the state of paths in which reception signals 7 received by the antennas 51 1 to 51n have been propagated. The propagation path state estimators 851 estimate the propagation path state in which the reception signals 7 received by the antennas 51 1 to 51n have been propagated based on the reception signals 7 received by the antennas 51 1 to 51n. The propagation path state estimators 851 input an estimated value of the propagation path state to the weight controller 808. The propagation path state estimators 851 input reception signals 7 to the time/frequency converters 52c. After the time/frequency converters 52 demultiplex the reception signals 7 into the reception signal 7 on each sub-carrier, processes similar to those in the receiver 505 shown in Fig. 19 are performed up to the combining of the reception signal on each sub-carrier over the spreading code duration. The signal to interference power ratio estimators 852 are interference state estimators for estimating the interference state between the reception signals 7. The signal to interference power ratio estimators 852 estimate the SIR of the reception signals 7 as the interference state of reception signal 7. The signal to interference power ratio estimators 852 estimate the SIR of reception signals 7 which have been combined over the spreading code duration by the symbol combining units 552g. The signal to interference power ratio estimator 852 are provided in a quantity equal to a number of the plurality of antennas 51 1 to 51n. In the receiver 805, the signal processing units 8521 to 852n associated with the antennas 511 to 51n have signal to interference power ratio estimators 852 for estimating the SIR of the reception signals 7 received by the antennas 51 1 to 51n. The signal to interference power ratio estimators 852 estimate the SIR of the reception signals 7 received by the antennas 51 1 to 51n based on the reception signals 7 received by the antennas 51 1 to 51n. The signal to interference power ratio estimators 852 input an estimated value of the SIR of the reception signals 7 to the weight controller 808. The signal to interference power ratio estimators 852 also input the reception signals 7 to the antenna weight multipliers 553. The weight controller 808 comprises an antenna weight controller 881 and a sub-carrier weight controller 882. The weight controller 808 adjusts antenna weights and sub-carrier weights such that spreading codes for the plurality of data channels #1 to #n are orthogonal to each other. The weight controller 808 preferably adjusts the antenna weights and sub-carrier weights such that spreading codes for the plurality of data channels #1 to #n are orthogonal to each other and such that the SNR is increased. The weight controller 808 adjusts the antenna weights and sub-carrier weights to determine the antenna weights and sub-carrier weights separately. The weight controller 808 adjusts the antenna weights and sub-carrier weights based on an estimated value of the propagation path state obtained by the propagation path state estimators 851. The weight controller 808 adjusts the antenna weights and sub-carrier weights based on the estimated value of SIR that is an estimated value of the interference state obtained by the signal to interference power ratio estimators 852. First, the sub-carrier weight controller 882 determines sub-carrier weights using ORC, MRC, EGC, or MMSEC. The sub-carrier control portions 821 to 828 shown in Fig. 12D and Figs. 13A to 13G may be used as the sub-carrier weight controller 882. The sub-carrier weight controller 882 preferably determines sub-carrier weights using MMSEC and, in particular, it is preferable to use the sub-carrier weight controller 826 shown in Fig. 13E. Next, the antenna weight controller 881 determines antenna weights based on the estimated value of the propagation path state. Specifically, the antenna weight controller 881 first controls a threshold value of the propagation path state to be used as a criterion for an adjustment of antenna weights and the sub-carrier weights. As a threshold value of the propagation path state to be used as a criterion for the adjustment of antenna weights and sub-carrier weights, the antenna weight controller 881 controls a threshold value be using as a criterion for determining antenna weights such that an antenna weight by which a reception signal 7 is multiplied becomes appropriate for a sub-carrier weight by which the reception signal 7 is previously multiplied. The threshold value of the propagation path state is preferably controlled such that an antenna weight will be determined using EGC or MRC in the case of a poor propagation path state and such that an antenna weight will be proportionate to an estimated value of SIR in the case of a good propagation path state. For example, when a delay spread is estimated as the propagation path state, control is performed such that an antenna weight is determined using EGC or MRC in the case of an estimated delay spread greater than the threshold value and such that an antenna weight proportionate to an estimated value of SIR is provided in the case of an estimated delay spread equal to or smaller than the threshold value. The antenna weight controller 881 preferably controls the threshold value for the propagation path state based on at least any of the type of modulation of the reception signals 7, the spreading code duration of the same, the number of multiplexed codes, and an other cell interference. The antenna weight controller 881 acquires the type of modulation, the spreading code duration, the number of multiplexed codes or the other cell interference from reception signals 7. The other cell interference is the quantity of interference with the receiver 805 from a cell other than the cell in which the receiver 805 resides. In the case of a propagation path state parameter that indicates a better propagation path state as its value decreases, e.g., a delay spread, the antenna weight controller 881 decreases the threshold value for the propagation path state, the smaller the number of multi-values of the modulation method, the spreading code duration, the number of multiplexed codes, and the other cell interference. The threshold value for the propagation path state is increased, the greater the number of multi-values of the modulation method, the spreading code duration, the number of multiplexed codes, and the other cell interference. Therefore, in the case of modulation methods involving a small number of multi-values such as QPSK and BPSK, the threshold value for the propagation path state decreases. In the case of modulation methods involving a large number of multi-values such as 16QAM and 64QAM, the threshold value for the propagation path state increases. On the contrary, in the case of a propagation path state parameter that indicates a better propagation path state as its value increases, the threshold value for the propagation path state is increased, the smaller the number of multi-values of the modulation method, the spreading code duration, the number of multiplexed codes, and the other cell interference. The threshold value for the propagation path state is decreased, the greater the number of multi-values of the modulation method, the spreading code duration, the number of multiplexed codes, and the other cell interference. Since the antenna weight controller 881 thus controls the threshold value for the propagation path state to be used as a criterion for the adjustment of the antenna weights and sub-carrier weights based on the modulation method, the spreading code duration, the number of multiplexed codes, and the other cell interference, the antenna weights and sub-carrier weights can be adjusted in consideration to the modulation method, the spreading code duration, the number of multiplexed codes, and the other cell interference. Next, the antenna weight controller 881 compares the controlled threshold value for the propagation path state with an estimated value of the propagation path state of each of the antennas 51 1 to 51n input from the propagation path state estimators 851. The antenna weight controller 881 determines antenna weights based on the result of the comparison. For example, when the propagation path state is undesirable, e.g., when an estimated value of delay spread is greater than the threshold value, the antenna weight controller 881 determines antenna weights using EGC or MRC. For example, the antenna weight controllers 812 and 813 shown in Figs. 10B and 10C may be used as the antenna weight controller 881. When the propagation path state is good, e.g., an estimated value of delay spread is equal to or smaller than the threshold value, the antenna weight controller 881 determines an antenna weight for each of the antennas 51 1 to 51n proportionate to an estimated value of the SIR of each of the antennas 51 1 to 51n. The antenna weight controller 881 uses an estimated value of the SIR of each of the antennas 51 1 to 51n input from the signal to interference power ratio estimator 852 to determine an antenna weight that is proportionate to the estimated value of SIR. As thus described, the weight controller 808 adjusts an antenna weight by which the antenna weight multiplier 881 multiplies a reception signal 7 which has been multiplied by a sub-carrier weight previously determined by the sub-carrier weight controller 882 based on an estimated values of the propagation path state and an estimated value of the interference state such as SIR. Thus, the weight controller 808 can adjust antenna weights and sub-carrier weights based on estimated values of the propagation path state and an estimated value of the interference state such as SIR. Thereafter, the antenna weight multipliers 553 multiply the reception signal 7 of each of the antennas 51 1 to 51n, which has been combined over the spreading code duration by an antenna weight. The antenna signal combining unit 554 combines the reception signals 7 multiplied by the antenna weights among the antennas 51 1 to 51n. The reception signal 7 combined by the antenna signal combining unit 554 is input to the serial/parallel converter 56. Thereafter, processes similar to those in the receiver 505 shown in Fig. 19 are performed to output data symbols. The receiver 805 may include an interference state estimating unit for estimating CIR of reception signals or interference power of reception signals 7 as the interference state between reception signals 7 instead of the signal to interference power ratio estimators 852. In this case, when the propagation path state is good, e.g., when an estimated value of delay spread is equal to or smaller than a threshold value, the antenna weight controller 881 determines an antenna weight proportionate to an estimated value of CIR or an antenna weight proportionate to the inverse number of interference power. In the receiver 805, since antenna diversity combining is performed after despreading, sub-carrier weights are determined first. When the receiver performs despreading after antenna diversity combining, the antenna weight controller determines antenna weights first. Then, the antenna signal combining unit combines the reception signals 7 multiplied by the antenna weights among the antennas. The signal to interference power ratio estimators 852 estimate the SIR of the reception signals 7 combined among the antennas. Then, the sub-carrier weight controller adjusts the sub-carrier weights by which the reception signals 7 multiplied by antenna weight are to be multiplied based on an estimated value of the propagation path state and an estimated value of SIR. The signal to interference power ratio estimators 852 may estimate the SIR of reception signals 7 on each sub-carrier before being combined over the spreading code duration by the symbol combining units 552g instead of the SIR of the reception signals 7 which have been combined over the spreading code duration by the symbol combining units 552g. Alternatively, the signal to interference power ratio estimators 852 may estimate the SIR of the reception signals 7 combined over the spreading code duration by the symbol combining units 552 and the SIR of the reception signal 7 on each sub-carrier before being combined. The weight controller 808 may compare the estimated SIR values before and after combining to control the antenna weights and sub-carrier weights using the SIR of higher accuracy. In the receiver 805, the antenna weight controller 881 acquires the modulation method of the reception signals 7, the spreading code duration, the number of multiplexed codes, the other cell interference, an estimated value of propagation path state, and estimated values of the interference state such as SIR as antenna weight data. When the antenna weight controller 881 determines antenna weights using EGC or MMSEC, it acquires antenna weight data from the reception signal 7 from each of the antennas which has been combined over the spreading code duration by the symbol combining units 552g, similar to the receiver 505 shown in Fig.19. The sub-carrier weight controller 882 can acquire sub-carrier weight data in the same way as done in the receiver 505 shown in Fig. 19. (Method of Communication) A description will now be made on reception of a reception signal using the receiver 805 shown in Fig. 29. As shown in Fig. 30, the antennas 51 1 to 51n of the receiver 805 receive a transmission signal 6 that is a multi-carrier CDMA signal (S701). Next, based on reception signals 7 received by the antennas 51 1 to 51n, the receiver 805 estimates delay spread as the propagation path state in which the reception signals 7 received by the antennas 51 1 to 51n have been propagated (S702). Next, the receiver 805 obtains estimated value of noise power, an estimated value of the number of multiplexed codes, and a channel estimate on a sub-carrier-by-sub-carrier basis for each of the reception signals 7 received by the antennas 51 1 to 51n. Then, the receiver 805 determines sub-carrier weights using MMSEC (S703). The receiver 805 multiplies the reception signal 7 on each sub-carrier received by the antennas 51 1 to 51n by a sub-carrier weight thus determined. The receiver 805 combines the reception signals over the spreading code duration (S704). The receiver 805 estimates the SIR of the reception signal 7 combined over the spreading code duration (S705). The receiver 805 determines an antenna weight for each of the antennas 51 1 to 51n using the estimated delay spread and SIR (S706). Specifically, the receiver 805 compares a threshold value for delay spread and the estimated value of delay spread. When the estimated value of delay spread is greater than the threshold value for delay spread, the receiver 805 determines the antenna weight using EGC or MRC. When the estimated value of delay spread is equal to or smaller than the threshold value for delay spread, the receiver 805 determines antenna weights proportionate to estimated values of the SIR of the reception signals 7 at the antennas 51 1 to 51n. Finally, the receiver 805 multiplies the reception signal 7 at each of the antennas 51 1 to 51n that have been combined over the spreading code duration by an antenna weight thus determined to perform combining among the antennas 51 1 to 51n (S707). The communication system, the receiver 805, and the method of communication as thus described can provide advantages substantially similar to those of the communication system 1, receiver 5, and the method of communication shown in Figs. 2, 8, and 15. Further, the propagation path state estimators 851 estimate the propagation path state. The signal power to interference power ratio estimating portion 852 estimates the interference state such as the SIR of the reception signals 7. The weight controller 808 adjusts the antenna weights and sub-carrier weights based on estimated values of the propagation path state and estimated values of the interference state. Thus, the receiver 805 can adequately determine the antenna weights and sub-carrier weights based on the propagation path state and the interference state between the reception signals 7. This allows the receiver 805 to improve the signal transmission characteristics further. The receiver 805 can be provided with a relatively simple configuration and can be easily controlled with a small control delay. [Eighth Embodiment] A description will now be made on a communication system and a method of communication according to an eighth embodiment of the invention. The communication system of the eighth embodiment has a receiver 905 as shown in Fig. 31. (Receiver) As shown in Fig. 31, the receiver 905 has a plurality of antennas 51 1 to 51n, a plurality of signal processing units 952 1 to 952n, a weight controller 908, a plurality of antenna weight multipliers 553, an antenna signal combining unit 554, a serial/parallel converter 56, a data demodulator 57, an error-correction-decoder 58, and a data symbol recovering unit 59. The signal processing units 952 1 to 952n have a symbol timing detector 52a, a guard interval deleting unit 52b, a time/frequency converter 52c, a spreading code generating unit 52d, a plurality of spreading code multipliers 52e, a plurality of sub-carrier weight multiplier 552f, a plurality of symbol combining portions 552g, and a signal to interference power ratio estimator 852. The plurality of antennas 51 1 to 51n, the plurality of antenna weight multipliers 553, the antenna signal combining unit 554, the serial/parallel converter 56, the data demodulator 57, the error-correction-decoder 58, the data symbol recovering unit 59, the symbol timing detectors 52a, the guard interval deleting units 52b, the time/frequency converters 52c, the spreading code generating units 52d, the plurality of spreading code multiplier 52e, the plurality of sub-carrier weight multiplier 552f, and the symbol combining units 552g are substantially similar to those in the receiver 505 shown in Fig. 19. The signal to interference power ratio estimators 852 are substantially similar to those in the receiver 805 shown in Fig. 29. Therefore, they are indicated by like reference numerals in Fig. 31 and will not be described here. After a transmission signal 6 is received by the plurality of antennas 51 1 to 51n, processes similar to those in the receiver 505 shown in Fig. 19 are performed up to the combining of reception signals 7 over the spreading code durations at the symbol combining units 552g. Next, the signal to interference power ratio estimators 852 estimate the SIR of the reception signals 7 combined over the spreading code durations by the symbol combining units 552g and input estimated SIR values of the reception signals 7 to the weight controller 908. The signal to interference power ratio estimators 852 input the reception signals 7 to the antenna weight multipliers 553. The weight controller 908 has an antenna weight controller 981 and a sub-carrier weight controller 982. The weight controller 908 adjusts antenna weights and sub-carrier weights such that the spreading codes for the plurality of data channels #1 to #n are orthogonal to each other. The weight controller 908 preferably adjusts antenna weights and sub-carrier weights such that the spreading codes for the plurality of data channels #1 to #n are orthogonal to each other and such that a great SNR is achieved. The weight controller 908 adjusts antenna weights and sub-carrier weights and determines antenna weights and sub-carrier weights separately. The weight controller 908 adjusts antenna weights and sub-carrier weights based on the estimated values of SIR obtained by the signal to interference power ratio estimators 852. First, the sub-carrier weight controller 982 determines sub-carrier weights using ORC, MRC, EGC, or MMSEC. The sub-carrier weight controllers 821 to 828 shown in Fig. 12D, and Figs. 13A to 13G may be used as the sub-carrier weight controller 982. The sub-carrier weight controller 982 preferably determines sub-carrier weights using MMSEC and, in particular, it is preferable to use the sub-carrier weight controller 826 shown in Fig. 13E. Then, the antenna weight controller 981 determines antenna weights based on estimated values of SIR. Specifically, the antenna weight controller 981 first controls a threshold value for SIR differences between the antennas to be used as a criterion for the adjustment of antenna weights and sub-carrier weights. As a threshold value for SIR differences between the antennas to be used as a criterion for the adjustment of antenna weights and sub-carrier weights, the antenna weight controller 981 controls a threshold value that be used as a criterion in determining antenna weights such that antenna weights by which reception signals 7 are multiplied will be appropriate for sub-carrier weights by which the reception signals have been previously multiplied. The threshold value for SIR differences between antennas is preferably controlled such that antenna weights are determined using EGC or MRC in the case of small SIR differences among the antennas and such that antenna weights are proportionate to SIR in the case of great SIR differences among the antennas. The antenna weight controller 981 preferably controls the threshold value for SIR differences between the antennas based on at least any of the modulation method of the reception signals 7, the spreading code duration, the number of multiplexed codes, and the other cell interference. The antenna weight controller 981 acquires the modulation method, the spreading code duration, the number of multiplexed codes or the other cell interference from the reception signals 7. The antenna weight controller 981 decreases the threshold value for SIR differences between the antennas, the smaller the number of multi-values of the modulation method, the spreading code duration, the number of multiplexed codes, and the other cell interference. It increases the threshold value, the greater the number of multi-values of the modulation method, the spreading code duration, the number of multiplexed codes, and the other cell interference. Since the antenna weight controller 981 controls the threshold value for SIR differences between the antennas to be used as a criterion for the adjustment of antenna weights and sub-carrier weights based on the modulation method, the spreading code duration, the number of multiplexed codes, and the other cell interference as thus described, antenna weights and sub-carrier weights can be adjusted in consideration to the modulation method, the spreading code duration, the number of multiplexed codes, and the other cell interference. Next, the antenna weight controller 981 calculates differences between SIRs of the antennas 51 1 to 51n based on an estimated SIR value of each of the antennas 51 1 to 51n input from the signal to interference power ratio estimators 852. For example, the antenna weight controller 981 calculates the difference between the maximum and minimum estimated SIR values of the antennas 51 1 to 51n. Next, the antenna weight controller 981 compares the controlled threshold value for SIR differences between the antennas with the calculated differences between estimated SIR values of the antennas 51 1 to 51n. The antenna weight controller 981 determines antenna weights based on the result of the comparison. The antenna weight controller 981 determines antenna weights using EGC or MRC when calculated differences between estimated SIR values of the antennas 51 1 to 51n are equal to or smaller than the threshold value for SIR differences between the antennas. When a calculated difference between estimated SIR values of the antennas 51 1 to 51n is in the excess of the threshold value for SIR differences between the antennas, the antenna weight controller 981 determines an antenna weight for each of the antennas 51 1 to 51n that is proportionate to the estimated SIR value of the respective one of the antennas 51 1 to 51n. For example, when the calculated difference between the maximum and minimum estimated SIR values of the antennas 51 1 to 51n is equal to or smaller than the threshold value for SIR difference between the antennas, the antenna weight controller 981 determines antenna weights using EGC or MRC. For example, the antenna weight controllers 812 and 813 shown in Figs, 10B and 10C may be used as the antenna weight controller 981. When the calculated difference between the maximum and minimum estimated SIR values of the antennas 51 1 to 51n is in the excess of the threshold value for SIR difference between the antennas, the antenna weight controller 981 determines an antenna weights for each of the antennas 51 1 to 51n that is proportionate to the estimated SIR value of the respective one of the antennas 51 1 to 51n. Thus, the weight controller 908 adjusts antenna weights to be multiplied at the antenna controller 981 on the reception signals 7 which have been multiplied by sub-carrier weights determined by the sub-carrier weight controller 982 in advance, based on estimated SIR values. This allows the weight controller 908 to adjust antenna weights and sub-carrier weights based on estimated SIR values. Thereafter, the antenna weight multipliers 553 multiply the reception signal 7 at each of the antennas 51 1 to 51n, which has been combined over the spreading code duration by an antenna weight. The antenna signal combining unit 554 combines the reception signals 7 multiplied by the antenna weights among the antennas 51 1 to 51n. The reception signal 7 combined by the antenna signal combining unit 554 is input to the serial/parallel converter 56. Processes similar to those in the receiver 505 shown in Fig. 19 are thereafter performed to output data symbols. The receiver 905 may have an interference state estimator for estimating CIRs of the reception signals 7 or interference power of the reception signals 7 as the interference state between the reception signals 7 instead of the signal to interference power ratio estimators 852. In this case, the antenna weight controller 981 calculates CIR differences or differences in interference power among the antennas 51 1 to 51n. When calculated values of CIR differences or interference power differences between the antennas 51 1 to 51n are equal to or smaller than a threshold value for CIR differences among the antennas or a threshold value for differences in interference power among the antennas, the antenna weight controller 981 determines antenna weights using EGC or MRC. When a calculated values of CIR differences or interference power differences among the antennas 51 1 to 51n is in the excess of the threshold value for CIR differences among the antennas or the threshold value for differences in interference power among the antennas, the antenna weight controller 981 determines antenna weights proportionate to estimated CIR values or antenna weights proportionate to the inverse numbers of interference power. In the receiver 905, sub-carrier weights are determined first because antenna diversity combining is performed after despreading. When the receiver performs despreading after antenna diversity combining, the antenna weight controller determines antenna weights first. Then, the antenna signal combining unit combines reception signals 7 multiplied by the antenna weights among the antennas. The signal to interference power ratio estimators 852 estimate SIRS of the reception signals 7 which have been combined among the antennas. The sub-carrier weight controller adjusts the sub-carrier weights by which the reception signals 7 multiplied by the antenna weights are to be multiplied based on estimated SIR values. In the receiver 905, the antenna weight controller 981 acquires the modulation method of the reception signals 7, the spreading code duration, the number of multiplexed codes, the other cell interference, and estimated values of the interference state such as SIR as antenna weight data. When the antenna weight controller 981 determines antenna weights using EGC or MRC, it acquires antenna weight data from the reception signal 7 at each antenna which have been combined over the spreading code duration by the symbol combining units 552g as done in the receiver 505 shown in Fig. 19. The sub-carrier weight controller 982 may acquire sub-carrier weight data as done in the receiver 505 shown in Fig. 19. (Method of Communication) A description will now be made on reception of a reception signal using the receiver 905 shown in Fig. 31. As shown in Fig. 32, the receiver 905 performs steps S801 to S804. Steps S801 to S804 are substantially similar to steps S701 and S703 to S705 shown in Fig. 30. Next, the receiver 905 determines an antenna weight for each of the antennas 51 1 to 51n using the estimated SIRs (S805). Specifically, the receiver 905 compares the threshold value for SIR differences among the antennas and the difference between the estimated SIR values among the antennas. When the difference between the estimated SIR values between the antennas is equal to or smaller than the threshold value, the receiver 905 determines antenna weights using EGC or MRC. When the difference between the estimated SIR values among the antennas is in the excess of the threshold value, the receiver 905 determines an antenna weights that is proportionate to the estimated SIR value of the reception signal 7 at each of the antennas 51 1 to 51n. Finally, the receiver 905 multiplies the reception signal 7 at each of the antennas 51 1 to 51n that has been combined over the spreading code duration by the antenna weight thus determined and performs combining among the antennas 51 1 to 51n (S806). The communication system, the receiver 905, and the method of communication as thus described can provide advantages substantially similar to those of the communication system 1, receiver 5, and the method of communication shown in Figs. 2, 8, and 15. Further, the signal to interference power ratio estimators 852 estimate SIRs of the reception signals. The weight controller 908 adjusts the antenna weights and the sub-carrier weights based on the estimated SIR values . Therefore, the receiver 905 can determine adequate antenna weights and sub-carrier weights depending on the interference state such as the SIRs of the reception signals 7. This allows the receiver 905 to improve the signal transmission characteristics further. Since the receiver 905 adjusts antenna weights and sub-carrier weights using estimated SIR values of the reception signals 7 which have been combined over the spreading code duration, adjustment can be performed with high accuracy. The receiver 905 can be provided with a relatively simple configuration and can be easily controlled with a small control delay. [Ninth Embodiment] A description will now be made on a communication system and a method of communication according to a ninth embodiment of the invention. The communication system of the ninth embodiment has a receiver 105 as shown in Fig. 33. (Receiver) As shown in Fig. 33, the receiver 105 has a plurality of antennas 51 1 to 51n, a plurality of signal processing units 152 1 to 152n, a weight controller 108, a plurality of antenna weight multipliers 553, an antenna signal combining unit 554, a serial/parallel converter 56, a data demodulator 57, an error-correction-decoder 58, a data symbol recovering unit 59, and a reception quality measuring unit 151. The signal processing units 152 1 to 152n have a symbol timing detector 52a, a guard interval deleting unit 52b, a time/frequency converter 52c, a spreading code generating unit 52d, a plurality of spreading code multiplier 52e, a plurality of sub-carrier weight multiplier 552f, a plurality of symbol combining units 552g and a signal to interference power ratio estimators 852. The plurality of antennas 51 1 to 51n, the plurality of antenna weight multipliers 553, the antenna signal combining unit 554, the serial/parallel converter 56, the data demodulator 57, the error-correction-decoder 58, the data symbol recovering unit 59, the symbol timing detector 52a, the guard interval deleting unit 52b, the time/frequency converter 52c, the spreading code generating unit 52d, the plurality of spreading code multipliers 52e, the plurality of sub-carrier weight multiplier 552f, and the symbol combining units 552g are substantially similar to those in the receiver 505 shown in Fig. 19. The signal to interference power ratio estimators 852 are substantially similar to those in the receiver 805 shown in Fig. 29. Therefore, they are indicated by like reference numerals in Fig. 33 and will not be described here. After a transmission signal 6 is received by the plurality of antennas 51 1 to 51n, processes similar to those in the receiver 505 shown in Fig. 19 are performed up to the combining of reception signals 7 over the spreading code duration at the symbol combining units 552g. Next, the signal to interference power ratio estimators 852 estimate SIRs of the reception signals 7 combined over the spreading code duration at the symbol combining units 552g and input estimated SIR values of the reception signals 7 to the weight controller 108. The signal to interference power ratio estimators 852 input the reception signals 7 to the antenna weight multipliers 553. Thereafter, the antenna weight multipliers 553 multiply the reception signal 7 at each of the antennas 51 1 to 51n combined over the spreading code duration by an antenna weight. The antenna signal combining unit 554 combines the reception signals 7 multiplied by the antenna weights among the antennas 51 1 to 51n. The reception signal 7 combined by the antenna signal combining unit 554 is input to the serial/parallel converter 56. Thereafter, processes similar to those in the receiver 505 shown in Fig. 19 until the data symbol recovering unit 59 is reached. The data symbol recovering unit 59 recovers data symbols which have been subjected to an error-correction-decoding process into a state in which they can be output to an output apparatus and inputs them to the reception quality measuring unit 151. The reception quality measuring unit 151 measures the reception quality of the data symbols recovered from the reception signals 7. The reception quality measuring unit 151 measures the bit error rate (BER) and frame error rate (FER) of the data symbols as the reception quality of the data symbols. The reception quality measuring unit 151 inputs measured values of the data symbols to the weight controller 108. The reception quality measuring unit 151 also outputs the data symbols. The weight controller 108 has an antenna weight controller 181 and a sub-carrier weight controller 182. The weight controller 108 adjusts antenna weights and sub-carrier weights such that the spreading codes for the plurality of data channels #1 to #n are orthogonal to each other. The weight controller 108 preferably adjusts antenna weights and sub-carrier weights such that the spreading codes for the plurality of data channels #1 to #n are orthogonal to each other and such that a great SNR will be achieved. The weight controller 108 adjusts antenna weights and sub-carrier weights and determines antenna weights and sub-carrier weights separately. The weight controller 108 adjusts the antenna weights and sub-carrier weights based on the measured value of reception quality obtained by the reception quality measuring unit 151. The weight controller 108 adjusts the antenna weights and sub-carrier weights based on the estimated SIR values obtained by the signal to interference power ratio estimators 852. First, the sub-carrier weight controller 182 determines sub-carrier weight using ORC, MRC, EGC, or MMSEC. The sub-carrier weight controllers 821 to 828 shown in Fig. 12D, and Figs. 13A to 13G may be used as the sub-carrier weight controller 182. The sub-carrier weight controller 182 preferably determines sub-carrier weights using MMSEC and, in particular, it is preferable to use the sub-carrier weight controller 826 shown in Fig. 13. Next, the antenna weight controller 181 determines antenna weights based on a measured value of reception quality. Specifically, the antenna weight controller 181 first controls a threshold value for variations of reception quality that is to serve as a criterion for the adjustment of antenna weights and sub-carrier weights. As a threshold value for variations of reception quality to serve as a criterion for the adjustment of antenna weights and sub-carrier weights, the antenna weight controller 181 controls a threshold value that uses as a criterion in determining antenna weights such that antenna weights by which reception signals7 are multiplied will be appropriate for sub-carrier weights by which the reception signals 7 have been previously multiplied. When a greater increase of reception quality indicates a greater reduction of reception quality, the threshold value for variations of reception quality is preferably controlled such that antenna weights different from the previously determined antenna weights can be determined in the case of a great increase of reception quality and such that the same antenna weights as the previously determined antenna weights can be determined in the case of a small increase of reception quality. For example, when BER or FER is measured as reception quality, control is performed such that antenna weights different from the previously determined antenna weights can be determined in the case of an increase of BER or FER in the excess of the threshold value and such that the same antenna weights as the previously determined antenna weights can be determined in the case of an increase of BER or FER equal to or smaller than the threshold value. On the contrary, when a greater decrease of reception quality indicates a greater reduction of reception quality, the threshold value for variations of reception quality is preferably controlled such that antenna weights different from the previously determined antenna weights can be determined in the case of a great decrease of reception quality and such that the same antenna weights as the previously determined antenna weights can be determined in the case of a small increase of reception quality. The antenna weight controller 181 preferably controls the threshold value for variations of reception quality based on at least any of the modulation method, the spreading code duration, the number of multiplexed codes, or the other cell interference of reception signals 7. The antenna weight controller 181 acquires the spreading code duration, the number of multiplexed codes, or the other cell interference of reception signals 7. When a greater increase of reception quality indicates a greater reduction of reception quality as BER or FER does, the antenna weight controller 181 sets a smaller threshold value for a increase of reception quality, the smaller the number of multi-values in the modulation method, the spreading code duration, the number of multiplexed codes, or the other cell interference. It sets a greater threshold value for variations of reception quality, the greater the number of multi-values in the modulation method, the spreading code duration, the number of multiplexed codes, or the other cell interference. On the contrary, when a greater decrease of reception quality indicates a greater reduction of reception quality, the antenna weight controller 181 sets a smaller threshold value for a decrease of reception quality, the smaller the number of multi-values in the modulation method, the spreading code duration, the number of multiplexed codes, or the other cell interference. It sets a greater threshold value for a decrease of reception quality, the greater the number of multi-values in the modulation method, the spreading code duration, the number of multiplexed codes, or the other cell interference. Thus, the antenna weight controller 181 controls the threshold value for variations of reception quality to serve as a criterion for the adjustment of antenna weights and sub-carrier weights based on the modulation method, the spreading code duration, the number of multiplexed codes, or the other cell interference, which allows antenna weights and sub-carrier weights to be adjusted in consideration to the modulation method, the spreading code duration, the number of multiplexed codes, or the other cell interference. The antenna weight controller 181 also holds a reference value for reception quality. Next, the antenna weight controller 181 compares the reference value of reception quality with a measured value of reception quality of data symbols input from the reception quality measuring unit 151. When the measured value of reception quality satisfies the reference value for reception quality, the antenna weight controller 181 determines antenna weights that are the same as the previously determined antenna weights. When the measured value of reception quality does not satisfy the reference value for reception quality, the antenna weight controller 181 calculates the variation of the measured value of reception quality. The antenna weight controller 181 holds the previous measured value of reception quality and calculates the difference between a measured value of reception quality newly input from the reception quality measuring unit 151 and the previous value. Next, the antenna weight controller 181 compares the controlled threshold value for variations of reception quality and the calculated variation of the measured value of reception quality. The antenna weight controller 181 determines antenna weights based on the result of the comparison. When an increase of a measured value of reception quality such as BER or FER is greater than the threshold value for variations of reception quality, the antenna weight controller 181 determines antenna weights that are different from the previously determined antenna weights. For example, when the previous antenna weights have been determined using EGC or MRC, the antenna weight controller 181 uses an estimated SIR value for each of the antennas 51 1 to 51n input from the signal to interference power ratio estimators 852 and determines an antenna weight proportionate to the estimated SIR value. When the previous antenna weights have been determined in proportion to estimated SIR values, the antenna weight controller 181 determines antenna weights using EGC or MRC. When an increase of a measured value of reception quality such as BER or FER is equal to or smaller than the threshold value for variations of reception quality, the antenna weight controller 181 determines antenna weights that are the same as the previously determined antenna weights. For example, when the previous antenna weights have been determined using EGC or MRC, the antenna weight controller 181 determines antenna weights using EGC or MRC. When the previous antenna weights have been determined in proportion to estimated SIR values, the antenna weight controller 181 uses an estimated SIR value for each of the antennas 51 1 to 51n input from the signal to interference power ratio estimators 852 and determines an antenna weight proportionate to the estimated SIR value. Thus, the weight controller 108 adjusts the antenna weights by which the antenna weight controller 181 is to multiply reception signals which have been multiplied by the sub-carrier weights determined by the sub-carrier weight controller 182 in advance, based on a measured value of reception quality of data symbols or estimated SIR values. This allows the weight controller to adjust antenna weights and sub-carrier weights based on a measured value of reception quality of data symbols or estimated SIR values. The receiver 105 may have an interference state estimator for estimating CIRs of the reception signals 7 or interference power of the reception signals 7 as the interference state between the reception signals 7 instead of the signal to interference power ratio estimators 852. In this case, the antenna weight controller 181 determines antenna weights that are proportionate to estimated CIR values or antenna weights that are proportionate to the inverse number of interference power. In the receiver 105, sub-carrier weights are determined first because antenna diversity combining is performed after despreading. When the receiver performs despreading after antenna diversity combining, the antenna weight controller determines antenna weights first. Then, the antenna signal combining unit combines reception signals 7 multiplied by the antenna weights among the antennas. The signal to interference power ratio estimators 852 estimate SIRs of the reception signals 7 which have been combined among the antennas. The sub-carrier weight controller adjusts the sub-carrier weights by which the reception signals 7 multiplied by the antenna weights are to be multiplied based on a measured value of reception quality of data symbols or estimated SIR values. In the receiver 105, the antenna weight controller 181 acquires the modulation method of the reception signals 7, the spreading code duration, the number of multiplexed codes, the other cell interference, and estimated values of the interference state such as SIR as antenna weight data. When the antenna weight controller 181 determines antenna weights using EGC or MRC, it acquires antenna weight data from the reception signal 7 at each antenna which has been combined over the spreading code duration by the symbol combining units 552g as done in the receiver 505 shown in Fig. 19. The sub-carrier weight controller 182 may acquire sub-carrier weight data as done in the receiver 505 shown in Fig. 19. (Method of Communication) A description will now be made on reception of a reception signal using the receiver 105 shown in Fig. 33. As shown in Fig. 34, the receiver 105 performs steps S901 to S904. Steps S901 to S904 are substantially similar to steps S801 and S804 shown in Fig. 32. Next, he receiver 105 determines an antenna weight for each of the antennas 51 1 to 51n using the measured value of reception quality of data symbols such as BER or FER and the estimated SIRs (S905). Specifically, the receiver 105 compares the reference value for reception quality and the measured value of reception quality of data symbols. When the measured value of reception quality satisfies the reference value for reception quality, the receiver 105 determines antenna weights that are the same as the previously determined antenna weights. When the measured value of reception quality does not satisfy the reference value for reception quality, the receiver 105 compares the threshold value for variations of reception quality and the variation of the measured value of reception quality. When an increase of the measured value of reception quality such as BER or FER is greater than the threshold value for variations of reception quality, the receiver 105 determines antenna weights that are different from the previously determined antenna weights. When an increase of the measured value of reception quality such as BER or FER is equal to or smaller than the threshold value for variations of reception quality, the antenna weight controller 181 determines antenna weights that are the same as the previously determined antenna weights. Then, the receiver 105 multiplies the reception signal 7 at each of the antennas 51 1 to 51n by which has been combined over the spreading code duration by an antenna weight thus determined and performs combining among the antennas 51 1 to 51n (S906). Finally, the receiver 105 measures the reception quality of data symbols, which have been recovered through despreading (S907). The measured value of reception quality obtained at step S07 is used at step S905 to determine the next antenna weights. The communication system, the receiver 105, and the method of communication as thus described can provide advantages substantially similar to those of the communication system 1, receiver 5, and the method of communication shown in Figs. 2, 8, and 15. Further, the reception quality measuring unit 151 measures reception quality of recovered data symbols. The signal to interference power ratio estimators 552 estimate SIRs of the reception signals 7. The weight controller 108 adjusts the antenna weights and the sub-carrier weights based on the estimated values of reception quality of data symbols and the estimated SIR values. Therefore, the receiver 105 can determine adequate antenna weights and sub-carrier weights depending on the reception quality of data symbols and the interference state such as the SIRs of the reception signals 7. This allows the receiver 105 to improve the signal transmission characteristics further. Especially, since the receiver 105 can determine antenna weights and sub-carrier weights with feedback of reception quality of recovered data symbols, antenna weights and sub-carrier weights can be more adequately determined. [Tenth Embodiment] Simulations made by the inventors will now be described. Despreading is performed after antenna diversity combining using the receiver 5 shown in Fig. 8. Antenna diversity combining is performed using the maximum ratio combining method, and despreading is performed in three approaches, i.e., MMSEC, EGC, and ORC (the schemes are hereinafter expressed by MRC(Div.)/MMSEC(Desp.), MRC(Div.)/EGC(Desp.), and MRC(Div.)/ORC(Desp.), respectively). Antenna diversity combining is performed using the equal gain combining method, and despreading is performed in two approaches, i.e., MMSEC and EGC (the schemes are hereinafter expressed by EGC(Div)/MMSEC(Desp.) and EGC(Div)/EGC(Desp.). Antenna diversity is performed after despreading using the receiver 505 shown in Fig. 19. Despreading is performed using MMSEC, and antenna diversity combining is performed using the equal gain combining method (the scheme is hereinafter expressed by MMSEC(Desp.)/EGC(Div.). For the purpose of comparison, despreading is performed simply using MMSEC and EGC. The simulations are carried out based on a spreading factor SF = 32, total number of paths L = 24, and a delay spread s = 0.29 \u00b5sec. Fig. 35 shows average received E b /N 0 (signal power to noise power density ratio per data bit) versus average packet error rate when the number of multiplexed codes Cmux = 8. As shown in Fig. 35, the best characteristics are achieved by the MMSEC(Desp.)/EGC(Div.) scheme in which despreading is performed using the receiver 505 shown in Fig. 19 according to MMSEC and antenna diversity is thereafter performed according to the equal gain combining method. With the receiver 505, inter-code interference attributable to destruction of orthogonality between spreading codes can be reduced at each antenna independently by using despreading employing MMSEC at each antenna. The subsequent antenna diversity combining allows combining that reflects differences in inter-code interference among the antennas. Compared to the simple despreading using MMSEC and EGC, high characteristics are achieved by any of the MRC(Div.)/MMSEC(Desp.), MRC(Div.)/EGC(Desp.),MRC(Div.)/ORC(Desp.), EGC(Div.)/MMSEC(Desp.), and EGC(Div.)/EGC(Desp.) schemes. Fig. 36 shows required average received E b /N 0 per antenna characteristics that satisfy an average packet error rate = 10 -2 relative to the number of multiplexed codes Cmux. As shown in Fig. 36, excellent characteristics can be achieved regardless of the number of multiplexed codes even when there is a great delay spread by the MMSEC(Desp./EGC(div.) scheme in which despreading is performed using the receiver 505 shown in Fig. 19 according to MMSEC and antenna diversity combining is thereafter performed according to EGC. Relatively good characteristics are achieved by the EGC(Div.)/EGC(Desp.), and EGC(Div.)/MMSEC(Desp.) schemes in which despreading is performed after antenna diversity combining. In the region of Cmux < 8 where the number of multiplexed codes is small, the MRC(Div.)/EGC(Desp.) scheme provides good characteristics in which despreading is performed after antenna diversity combining using the receiver 5 shown in Fig. 8. As apparent from the above, when the receiver 5 is used it is preferable to use MRC that provides a great diversity gain for diversity combining and to perform despreading using EGC for which no consideration is needed about noise power variation at each sub-carrier attributable to MRC in a region there is only small influence of inter-code interference. Fig. 37 shows required average received E b /N 0 characteristics that satisfy an average packet error rate = 10 -2 relative to a spreading factor SF. Fig. 37 shows characteristics achieved when the number of multiplexed codes normalized by the spreading factor (Cmux/SF) is 1. As shown in Fig. 37, excellent characteristics can be achieved regardless of the spreading factor by the MMSEC(Desp.)/EGC(div.) scheme in which despreading is performed using the receiver 505 shown in Fig. 19 according to MMSEC and antenna diversity is thereafter performed using EGC. When the number of multiplexed codes is thus small compared to the spreading factor, significant improvement of characteristics is achieved by the MMSEC(Desp.)/EGC(Div.) scheme which is carried out using the receiver 505 and which reflects differences in inter-code interference among the antennas. Fig. 38 shows required average received E b /N 0 characteristics that satisfy an average packet error rate = 10 -2 relative to a fading correlation coefficient between antennas. Fig. 38 shows characteristics achieved when the number of multiplexed codes Cmux = 8. As shown in Fig. 38, good characteristics can be achieved when the correlation coefficient is small with the MMSEC(Desp.)/EGC(div.) scheme in which despreading is performed using the receiver 505 shown in Fig. 19 according to MMSEC and antenna diversity is thereafter performed using EGC. [Modification] The invention is not limited to the above-described first through tenth embodiments and may be modified in various ways. For example, a transmitter may have a number of multiplexed codes data generating unit 41i and a data generating unit 41j as shown in Fig. 39. The number of multiplexed codes data generating unit 41i generates data concerning the number of multiplexed codes corresponding to the number of the data channels #1 to #n that are to be code-division-multiplexed (hereinafter referred to as number of multiplexed codes data) and inputs it to the data symbol generating unit 41a. The data generating unit 41j generates data other than the number of multiplexed codes data, i.e., data such as images and data such as sound transmitted to a terminal apparatus and inputs the same to the data symbol generating unit 41a. Based on the number of multiplexed codes data input from the number of multiplexed codes data generating unit 41i and the data other than the number of multiplexed codes data input from the data generating unit 41j, the data symbol generating unit 41a generates data symbols including both of the data. The transmitter transmits a data signal including the number of multiplexed codes data to a receiver. Therefore, the receiver can acquire the number of multiplexed codes data from the data signal included in a reception signal 7. Since this eliminates the need for the process of estimating the number of multiplexed codes at the sub-carrier weight controllers 826 and 829 shown in Figs. 13E and 26 and consequently eliminates the need for the number of multiplexed codes estimating parts 826c and 829c, the process and configuration can be simplified. The sub-carrier weight controllers 826 and 829 may obtain sub-carrier weights using an actual exact value of the number of multiplexed codes instead of an estimated value. This allows the sub-carrier weight controllers 826 and 829 to obtain more adequate sub-carrier weights. As shown in Fig. 40, a receiver may have a plurality of adding units 52g. Each spreading code multiplier 52e inputs a reception signal 7 on the respective sub-carrier multiplied by a spreading code to the adding unit 52g. Let us assume that the reception signals 7 on a sub-carrier-by-sub-carrier basis input to the adding unit 52g are numbered by #1 to #n (n is a natural number). Each of the adding units 52g adds the reception signals 7 #1 to #n on a sub-carrier-by-sub-carrier basis input thereto and averages them in the direction of frequency. The adding units 52g input the added reception signals 7 to the antenna weight multiplier 52f. The number of reception signals 7 on a sub-carrier-by-sub-carrier basis input to the adding units 52g may be different for each adding unit 52g. Thus, the adding units 52g add the reception signals 7 which have been multiplied by spreading codes at the spreading code multiplier 52e and average them in the direction of frequency. Therefore, after the reception signals 7 are added and averaged in the direction of frequency by the adding units 52g, the antenna weight multiplier, sub-carrier weight multiplier, and collective weight multiplier can multiply the reception signals 7 by sub-carrier weights, antenna weights, and collective weights. Therefore, the weight controller can reduce the numbers of antenna weights, sub-carrier weights, and collective weights to be determined, which makes it possible to reduce the load of the process for determining weights. Since the number of the antenna weight multipliers, sub-carrier weight multipliers, and collective weight multipliers can be reduced, the configuration of the receiver can be simplified. Especially, when the sub-carrier weight controllers 827 to 829 shown in Figs. 13F, 13G, and 26 are provided as sub-carrier weight controllers and sub-carrier weights are obtained using adaptive algorithm, the amount of calculations carried out by the weight updating parts 827c, 828d, and 829g increases with the number of sub-carrier weights (this applies to the weight controller 308 when it has such features). Therefore, a reduction of the number of sub-carriers to be determined makes it possible to reduce the amount of calculations carried out by the weight updating parts 827c, 828d, and 829g and to reduce the load on them. As shown in Fig. 41, a receiver may have a plurality of delaying devices 52h and a plurality of adding units 52i. The spreading code multipliers 52e inputs reception signals 7 on a sub-carrier-by-sub-carrier basis multiplied by spreading codes to the delaying devices 52h and adding units 52i. In order to add m reception signals 7 on a sub-carrier-by-sub-carrier basis input thereto in the direction of the time axis, the plurality of delaying devices 52h generate m-1 reception signals 7 on a sub-carrier-by-sub-carrier basis that are shifted in time (m is a natural number). A reception signal 7 on a sub-carrier-by-sub-carrier basis directly input from the spreading code multipliers 52e is used as the last signal. Therefore, m-1 delay devices 52h are provided. Each delay device 52h delays a reception signal 7 input thereto by a predetermined delay time (Ts) and inputs it to the next delay device 52h and to the adding units 52i. The delay time (Ts) is set at one symbol length. The adding units 52i add a plurality of (m) reception signals 7 on a sub-carrier-by-sub-carrier basis input at different times in the direction of the time axis and average them in the direction of the time axis. The adding units 52i input the added reception signals 7 to the antenna weight multipliers 52f. The number of reception signals 7 on a sub-carrier-by-sub-carrier basis input to the adding units 52i may be different between for each of the adding units 52i. Since the reception signals 7 on a sub-carrier-by-sub-carrier basis are thus averaged in the direction of the time axis, the signal power to noise power ratio (SNR) of the reception signals 7 can be increased by combining the averaged reception signals 7 over the spreading code duration and by despreading the same. Especially, when the sub-carrier weight controllers 827 to 829 shown in Figs. 13F, 13G, and 26 are provided as sub-carrier weight controllers and sub-carrier weights are obtained using adaptive algorithm, the signal power to noise power ratio of the reception signals 7 after despreading used for determining sub-carrier weight will be great (this applies to the weight controller 308 when it has such features). This makes it possible to determine sub-carrier weights with increased accuracy at an increased speed. The receiver may have a sub-carrier weight controller 830 and a sub-carrier weight multiplier 52j as shown in Fig. 42 as a sub-carrier weight controller and a sub-carrier weight multiplier. Alternatively, a weight controller having the configuration of the sub-carrier weight controller 830 may be used, and a collective weight multiplier that multiply collective weights in the position of the sub-carrier weight multiplier 52j may be used. The sub-carrier weight controller 830 has a bit string holding portion 830a, a reference symbol generating portion 830b, a plurality of symbol replicating portions 830c, a spreading code multiplier 830d, a frequency/time converter 830e, an error estimator 830f, and a weight updating unit 830g. The bit string storage unit 830a and the reference symbol generating unit 830b are substantially similar to the bit string storage unit 825b and the reference symbol generating part 825c of the sub-carrier weight controller 825 shown in Fig. 13D. The reference symbol generating unit 830b inputs a reference symbol that it generates to the symbol replicating portions 830c. The symbol replicating portions 830c replicate the reference symbol in a quantity equal to the number of the spreading code durations of the spreading codes. The spreading code multiplier 830d multiplies the replicated reference symbols by spreading codes to obtain a reference signal. The frequency/time converter 830e performs frequency/time conversion on the reference signal to generate a reference signal that is spread among a plurality of sub-carriers (hereinafter referred to as \"reference multi-carrier CDMA signal\"). The frequency/time converter 830e inputs the reference multi-carrier CDMA signal to the error estimator 830f. The sub-carrier weight multiplier 52j is provided upstream of the time/frequency converter 52c. The sub-carrier weight multiplier 52j multiplies a reception signal 7 by a sub-carrier weight. The sub-carrier weight multiplier 52j inputs the reception signal 7 multiplied by the sub-carrier weight to the error estimator 830f and the time/frequency converter 52c. The error estimator 830f estimates an error between the reception signal which has been multiplied by the sub-carrier weight and which has not been subjected to time/frequency conversion process at the time/frequency converter 52c and the reference multi-carrier CDMA signal. The weight updating unit 830g obtains a weight that is gradually updated to minimize a mean square error of the error between the reception signal 7 which has been multiplied by the sub-carrier weight input from the error estimator 830f and which has not been subjected to a time/frequency conversion process at the time/frequency converter 52c and the reference multi-carrier CDMA signal using adaptive algorithm. The sub-carrier weight controller 830 a sub-carrier weight 830h thus obtained to the sub-carrier weight multiplier 52j. This makes it possible to update the sub-carrier weight to minimize a mean square error between a reception signal 7 which has not been subjected to a time/frequency conversion process at the time/frequency converter 52c and a transmission signal 6. As a result, the sub-carrier weight controller 830 achieves an effect that is similar to updating the sub-carrier weight such that a mean square error between the reception signal 7 after dispreading and the transmission signal 6 is minimized.", "tags": ["H04B"]}
{"_id": "EP1310655A2", "docid": "EP1310655A2", "title": "Fuel injection system", "text": "The present invention relates to a fuel injection system that has a safety valve for keeping fuel pressure below a predetermined pressure, specifically, the present invention provides a method of and apparatus for executing a failsafe control when the safety valve is activated. Generally, a conventional fuel injection system pressurizes fuel and supplies pressurized fuel to cylinder through an injector. In order to keep a fuel pressure within an appropriate range, the fuel injection system may have a safety valve for discharging pressurized fuel from an accumulator or the like when the fuel pressure exceeds a predetermined pressure. The safety valve may be called as a pressure suppresser, a relief valve or a pressure limiter. The safety valve enters an opened state in response to a fuel pressure exceeding the limit setting pressure. A common rail type fuel injection system is known as a fuel injection system for diesel engines. The common rail type fuel injection system handles high-pressure fuel. Therefore, it is required not only to keep fuel pressure within a predetermined appropriate range, but also to keep the engine running even if the safety valve is activated. A high-pressure supply pump accumulates high-pressure fuel in a common rail serving as an accumulator by applying a pressures to the fuel in an operation called a pressure feed operation. The high-pressure fuel accumulated in the common rail is then distributed to a plurality of injectors each provided on a cylinder employed in a multi-cylinder engine. The high-pressure fuel distributed to the injectors is finally injected and supplied into a combustion chamber. An inlet metering valve provided at the inlet of the high-pressure supply pump. The inlet metering valve is used for changing and adjusting fuel volume discharged by the high-pressure pump to the common rail by adjusting the intake volume of fuel introduced into the inlet of the high-pressure supply pump. The high-pressure pump is driven by the engine. A pressure limiter is provided on at least one of a fuel pipe connecting the high-pressure supply pump to the injectors and the common rail. The pressure limiter discharges fuel from the fuel pipe or the common rail to decrease the fuel pressure when the fuel pressure in the fuel pipe and the common rail exceeds a predetermined limit pressure. Such an abnormally excess pressure may be caused by a malfunction on the inlet metering valve. For example, if the inlet metering valve is completely opened due to a mechanical malfunction or a short circuiting, the high-pressure supply pump feeds excessive amount of fuel into the common rail and raises the fuel pressure. The pressure limiter prevents excessive increase of the fuel pressure and assures the reliability of the common rail type fuel injection system. That is, in a completely opened state of the inlet metering valve with the multi-cylinder engine rotating at an idle revolution speed, the pressure limiter enters an opened valve state because the pressure of fuel in the common rail exceeds the limit setting pressure, letting fuel flow from the fuel pipe and the common rail to the low-pressure side so that the pressure of fuel decreases to a level not higher than the limit setting pressure. As a result, it is possible to assure the reliability of the common rail type fuel injection apparatus. With the conventional common rail type fuel injection apparatus, however, in an idle state with a small pump fed volume, the pressure limiter enters an opened valve state and a closed valve state alternately in a repeated manner. For example, due to a small pump fed volume, the common rail pressure may swing between an open pressure and a close pressure of the pressure limiter during the engine is operated under an idling state as shown in Fig. 7. Thus, the pressure of fuel in the common rail and the fuel injection volume become unstable, raising a problem of the engine's rotational instability. At the same time, the increased number of times the pressure limiter enters an opened valve state and a closed valve state alternately causes spring fatigue and a bad seal seat, raising a problem of impossibility to assure reliability of the pressure limiter. In addition, if the inlet metering valve provided at the inlet of the high-pressure supply pump is an electromagnetic valve of the normally closed type, a breakage of a wiring harness connecting a pump driving circuit to the inlet metering valve results in no fuel discharged from the high-pressure supply pump so that it is impossible to sustain a common rail type fuel pressure and a fuel injection volume, which are required to operate the multi-cylinder engine. As a result, there is raised a problem called an engine stall. In the case of a normally open electromagnetic valve employed as the inlet metering valve, the high-pressure supply pump supplies fuel at an excessively high pressure or at a maximum flow rate in the event of an abnormality as shown in time charts of Figs. 13 and 14. Examples of the abnormality are an abnormality of a completely open state of the inlet metering valve and an abnormality of a completely closed state of the inlet metering valve. The abnormality of a completely open state of the inlet metering valve is typically caused by a broken wire harness for supplying a pump drive signal from an electronic control unit (ECU) to the inlet metering valve or an abnormality of control executed by the ECU. On the other hand, the abnormality of a completely closed state of the inlet metering valve is typically caused by a foreign substance inadvertently between a valve body and a valve seat of the inlet metering valve. In the conventional common rail fuel injection system, however, a fuel discharge caused by a valve opening operation of the pressure limiter and a fuel leakage caused by an abnormality and/or a failure of a high-pressure pipe route cannot be distinguished from each other. An example of the abnormality and/or the failure of a high-pressure pipe route is a burst of a high-pressure pipe. For example, a fuel discharge caused by an opened valve state of the pressure limiter may be detected as a fuel leakage by leakage detection logic as shown in the time charts of Figs. 13 and 14, and a failsafe measure such as an operation to stop the engine is taken. However, there is raised a problem of the driver's excessively aroused anxiety. When the pressure limiter is put in an opened valve state due to an excessive pressure applied by the high-pressure supply pump, for example, it is desirable to let the vehicle continue its running state so as to realize the limp home running of the vehicle. It is thus an object of the present invention to provide a fuel injection system capable of assuring reliability of a pressure safety valve by eliminating idle performance instability caused by operations to open and close the pressure safety valve repeatedly. It is another object of the present invention to provide a fuel injection system capable of avoiding an engine stall and putting the vehicle in a smooth limp home state in the event of an excessive pressure feed of the high-pressure supply pump. It is still another object of the present invention to provide a fuel injection system capable of improving reliability and safety by execution of engine control whereby implementation of failsafe control is changed in accordance with the type of a fuel pressure decrease. It is yet another object of the present invention to provide a fuel injection system capable of improving reliability and safety by identifying an abnormality which may be caused by an operation of a pressure safety valve or a state of an excessively high pressure feed supplied by a high-pressure supply pump from several abnormalities of the fuel injection system, and by providing an appropriate failsafe control. In accordance with a first aspect of the present invention, when a high-pressure supply pump excessively supplies high-pressure fuel to an accumulator or when an abnormal pressure increase in the accumulator is detected, an idle revolution speed is raised to a value higher than a steady state speed. The fuel discharging performance of the high-pressure supply pump is increased due to the increased idle revolution speed. As a result, a pressure safety valve is maintained in opened state. By eliminating the accumulator's fuel pressure instability caused by operations to open and close the pressure safety valve repeatedly as well as instability of the fuel injection volume and by eliminating instability of the idle performance, reliability deterioration of the pressure safety valve can be reduced. Therefore, the reliability of the accumulator fuel injection system can be improved. An operation to raise the idle revolution speed to a value higher than the steady state speed is equivalent to an operation to increase the fuel injection volume to a value greater than the fuel injection volume at the idle revolution speed in a steady state by at least a predetermined amount. In other words, an operation to raise the idle revolution speed to a value higher than the steady state speed is equivalent to an operation to increase the duration of an injector driving pulse or the width of the injector driving pulse to a value greater than a pulse duration or a pulse width corresponding to the idle revolution speed in a steady state by at least a predetermined duration or width. The high-pressure supply pump may be provided with a metering valve for adjusting a fuel amount discharged from the high-pressure supply pump. The metering valve may be an inlet metering valve. The inlet metering valve is provided on an inlet side of the high-pressure supply pump. The inlet metering valve adjusts the injection volume of fuel introduced into the high-pressure supply pump so that the volume of fuel discharged from the high-pressure supply pump to the accumulator is adjusted. The metering valve may be a discharged fuel metering valve. The discharged fuel metering valve is provided on the discharge port of the high-pressure supply pump. The discharged fuel metering valve adjusts the volume of fuel discharged from the discharge port of the high-pressure supply pump to the accumulator. The metering valve may be a normally open type valve. The pressure safety valve may be configured to regulate fuel pressure in the common rail when the pressure safety valve itself continuously opens. In accordance with another aspect of the present invention, an inlet metering valve or a discharged fuel metering valve is used to adjust fuel amount supplied to the accumulator. The inlet metering valve or the discharged fuel metering valve is implemented as a normally open type. The system has a pressure safety valve which has a pressure regulating function capable of sustaining the pressure of fuel in the accumulator at a regulated level in the event of a completely opened state abnormality of the inlet metering valve or the discharged fuel metering valve. Even if the pressure safety valve is once put in an opened state, the vehicle can be put in a limp home state. The regulated level is a pressure required to put the vehicle in a limp home state in a state of an emergency requiring an urgent rescue such as an excessive pressure feed of high-pressure fuel supplied by the high-pressure supply pump to the accumulator. The regulated level is higher than an injector operating pressure but is such a sufficiently low pressure that a noise, a knocking sound and the like are not generated. The completely opened state abnormality of the inlet metering valve or the discharged fuel metering valve is an excessive pressure feed of high-pressure fuel supplied by the high-pressure supply pump to the accumulator or an abnormal pressure increase in the accumulator. In accordance with a still another aspect of the present invention, a leakage quantity finding means computes a quantity of a fuel leakage from a high-pressure pipe route on the basis of an engine operating state detected by an engine operating state detection means, a high-pressure supply pump operating state detected by an operating state detection means or the high-pressure pipe route fuel pressure detected by a fuel pressure sensor. If a quantity of a fuel leakage computed by the leakage quantity finding means is greater than a first predetermined value but does not exceed a second predetermined value, a small fuel leakage from the high-pressure pipe route is determined to exist and a failsafe measure such as an action to limit the output of the engine is taken. If a quantity of a fuel leakage computed by the leakage quantity finding means is greater than the second predetermined value, a large fuel leakage from the high-pressure pipe route is determined to exist and a failsafe measure such as an action to stop the engine is taken. Thus, the engine can be controlled by executing the failsafe control in different ways in dependence on the quantity of a fuel leakage. In particular, when a small fuel leakage from the high-pressure pipe route is determined to exist, the engine is not stopped but the output of the engine is limited. Thus, it is possible to allow a running state to continue in order to realize limp home running. When a large fuel leakage from the high-pressure pipe route is determined to exist, the engine is stopped. This is because a large fuel leakage may be conceivably caused by an engine abnormality including an abnormality and/or a failure of the high-pressure pipe route. As described above, an example of an abnormality and/or a failure of the high-pressure pipe route is a burst of a high-pressure pipe. As a result, it is possible to improve the common rail fuel injection system reliability and safety. In accordance with a yet another aspect of the present invention, a leakage quantity finding means computes a quantity of a fuel leakage from a high-pressure pipe route on the basis of parameters representing at least one of an engine operating state detected by an engine operating state detection means, a high-pressure supply pump operating state detected by an operating state detection means or the high-pressure pipe route fuel pressure detected by a fuel pressure sensor. If a quantity of a fuel leakage computed by the leakage quantity finding means is greater than a predetermined value and the high-pressure pipe route fuel pressure detected by the fuel pressure sensor exceeds a predetermined pressure level, a pressure decrease caused by an opened state of a pressure safety valve or an excessive pressure feed state by the high-pressure supply pump is determined to exist and a failsafe measure such as an action to limit the output of the engine is taken. Thus, if the pressure safety valve is opened in an excessive pressure feed supplied by the high-pressure supply pump, the fuel pressure in the high-pressure pipe route decreases due to an opened state of the pressure safety valve, that is, if a fuel escape exists due to an opened state of the pressure safety valve, the engine is not stopped but the output of the engine is limited. Thus, it is possible to let the vehicle continue its running state so as to realize the limp home running. If a fuel leakage quantity computed by the leakage quantity finding means is greater than a predetermined value and the high-pressure pipe route fuel pressure detected by the fuel pressure sensor does not exceed a predetermined pressure level, a system abnormality including an abnormality and/or a failure of the high-pressure pipe route is determined to exist, and a failsafe measure such as an action to stop the engine is taken. As described above, an example of an abnormality and/or a failure of the high-pressure pipe route is a burst of a high-pressure pipe. As a result, it is possible to improve the common rail fuel injection system's reliability and safety. The predetermined pressure level may be a pressure value greater than an upper limit of a range used normally in the fuel injection system but smaller than the pressure safety valve opened state pressure corresponding to a limit setting pressure. Thus, the predetermined pressure level is never equal to a pressure value within the a range used normally in the fuel injection system and never becomes equal to or exceeds the pressure safety valve opened state pressure corresponding to a limit setting pressure. In addition, when the high-pressure pipe route fuel pressure detected by the fuel pressure sensor exceeds the predetermined pressure level, the fuel pressure in the high-pressure pipe route can always be determined to be abnormal. Thus, the control precision of the fuel injection system can be improved without regard to the detection precision of the fuel pressure sensor. The predetermined pressure level may be set for each vehicle or each engine in accordance with the fuel pressure sensor output characteristic and the pressure safety valve opening characteristic, which vary from vehicle to vehicle or from engine to engine. Thus, since it is possible to set a predetermined pressure level for a vehicle or an engine by considering the particular output characteristic of the fuel pressure sensor of the vehicle or the engine and the particular opening characteristic of the pressure safety valve of the vehicle or the engine, the fuel pressure in the high-pressure pipe route can always be determined to be abnormal when the high-pressure pipe route fuel pressure detected by the fuel pressure sensor exceeds the predetermined pressure level. An injection volume determination means may be constructed to find an injection volume of fuel injected to an engine from an injector of each cylinder on the basis of the engine operating state detected by an engine operating state detection means whereas a leak quantity determination means computes a quantity of a fuel leak from a high-pressure pipe route on the basis of the engine operating state detected by an engine operating state detection means, the injection volume calculated by the fuel volume determination means and the high-pressure pipe route fuel pressure detected by a fuel pressure sensor. Thus, the quantity of the fuel leak from the high-pressure pipe route can be computed with a high degree of precision. A leakage quantity finding means may be constructed to compute a quantity of a fuel leakage from a high-pressure pipe route on the basis of an engine operating state detected by an engine operating state detection means, a fuel injection volume calculated by a fuel volume determination means, a fuel pressure fed volume calculated by a pressure fed volume determination means and a fuel leak quantity calculated by a leak quantity determination means. Thus, the quantity of the fuel leakage from the high-pressure pipe route can be computed with a high degree of precision.

A plurality of embodiments of the present invention is explained by referring to the drawings. FIRST EMBODIMENT Fig. 1 is a diagram showing an overall configuration of a common rail type fuel injection system. The common rail type fuel injection system implemented by the embodiment comprises a plurality of injectors 2, a high-pressure supply pump 3, a common rail 4 and an electronic control unit 10. In this embodiment, 4 injectors 2 are employed. Each of the injectors 2 is provided for a cylinder of a multi-cylinder internal combustion engine 1 such as a multi-cylinder diesel engine. In the following description, the multi-cylinder internal combustion engine is referred to simply as a multi-cylinder engine 1. The high-pressure supply pump 3 is driven by the multi-cylinder engine 1 into rotation. The common rail 4 serves as an accumulator for accumulating high-pressure fuel discharged at a high pressure by the high-pressure supply pump 3. The electronic control unit 10 electronically controls the injectors 2 of the cylinders and the high-pressure supply pump 3. The electronic control unit 10 is referred to hereafter as an ECU 10. The common rail type fuel injection system also has a pressure safety valve 6 used as a pressure limiter 6 for suppressing the pressure of fuel in the common rail 4 to a level below a limit setting pressure by entering an opened valve state when the pressure of fuel in the common rail 4 exceeds the limit setting pressure. The pressure of fuel in the common rail 4 is also referred to hereafter as a common rail pressure. The injectors 2 of the cylinders are each a fuel injection nozzle connected to a high-pressure pipe linked to the downstream end of a branch pipe 15 branching from the common rail 4. There are employed as many branch pipes 15 as the injectors 2. Each of the injectors 2, which each serve as a fuel injection nozzle, supplies by injection high-pressure fuel accumulated in a pressurized state in the common rail 4 to a combustion chamber of a cylinder provided on the multi-cylinder engine 1 for the injector 2. Injection of fuel from the injectors 2 to the multi-cylinder engine 1 is electronically controlled by turning on and off an injection control electromagnetic valves serving an electromagnetic actuators provided on the branch pipes 15. The injection control electromagnetic valves themselves are not shown in the figure. That is, when the injection control electromagnetic valve in an injector 2 for a cylinder of the multi-cylinder engine 1 is in an open state, high-pressure fuel accumulated in the common rail 4 in a pressurized state is injected into a combustion chamber of the cylinder. The high-pressure supply pump 3 has a commonly known feed pump not shown in the figure, a plunger and a plunger chamber. Driven by a pump driving shaft 12 rotated by the revolution of a crankshaft 11 of the multi-cylinder engine 1, the feed pump serves as a low-pressure supplying pump used for pumping up fuel from a fuel pump 9. The feed pump is also referred to as a low-pressure feed pump. Also omitted from the figure, the plunger is driven by the pump driving shaft 12 as well. Also not shown in the figure, the plunger chamber functions as a pressure-applying chamber for applying a pressure to fuel as a result of a reciprocating motion of the plunger. The high-pressure supply pump 3 serves as a supply pump for applying a pressure to fuel sucked out by the low-pressure supply pump from a fuel pipe 13 and discharging the high-pressure fuel to the common rail 4 from a discharge port. An inlet metering valve 7 is provided on the inlet side of the fuel route leading to the pressure-applying chamber. The inlet metering valve 7 is used as an electromagnetic actuator for changing the volume of fuel discharged from the high-pressure supply pump 3 to the common rail 4 by opening and closing the fuel route. In the common rail 4, a high pressure corresponding to the injection pressure needs to be sustained continuously. In order to sustain such a high pressure, the common rail 4 is connected to the discharge port of the high-pressure supply pump 3 by a fuel pipe 16, which is also a portion of a high-pressure pipe route. As described earlier, the high-pressure supply pump 3 discharges high-pressure fuel from the discharge port. It is to be noted that fuel leaking from the injectors 2, fuel leaking from a pressure limiter 6 and fuel leaking from the high-pressure supply pump 3 are returned to the fuel tank 9 by way of a leak pipe 14, which is a low-pressure route. The fuel pressure in the common rail 4 is also referred to as a common rail pressure. As sown in Fig. 2, the pressure limiter 6 comprises a housing 20, a valve body 21, a valve needle 23 and a spring 25. The housing 20 is hermetically connected between the left end of the common rail 4 and the upper end of the leak pipe 14 so that no liquid should leak out. The valve body 21 is attached to an end of the housing 20 so that the valve body 21 is located between the housing 20 and the common rail 4. The valve needle 23 opens and closes a valve hole 22 provided on the valve body 21. The spring 25 applies a predetermined pressing force to the valve needle 23 toward a valve seat 24 to be seated on the valve seat 24 to close the valve hole 22. In the housing 20, there are created an inlet side fuel hole 27, a small diameter hole 29 and an outlet side fuel hole 30. A fuel hole 28 is formed through a spring sheet 26 provided on the top of the inlet side fuel hole 27. The spring sheet 26 serves as a shim for adjusting the pressure to open the valve of the pressure limiter 6. On the outer circumference of the bottom of the housing 20, a male screw portion 31 is created to be engaged with a link portion of the common rail 4. The link portion itself is shown in none of the figures. On the inner circumference of the outlet side fuel hole 30 on the rear end of the housing 20, a female screw portion 32 is created to be engaged with a link portion of the leak pipe 14. The rear end of the housing 20 is the upper end shown in the figure and the link portion of the leak pipe 14 is not shown in the figure. On the downstream side relative to the valve hole 22 of the valve body 21, a slide hole 33 is created for holding a shaft shaped portion 37 of the valve needle 23 in such a way that the shaft shaped portion 37 can be sled along the slide hole 33 with a high degree of freedom. Two or more shaft direction cut grooves 34 are created at intervals or at symmetrical locations so that, with the shaft shaped portion 37 of the valve needle 23 lifted from the valve seat 24, fuel can pass through a gap between the shaft shaped portion 37 and the slide hole 33. The end of the shaft shaped portion 37 of the valve needle 23 is created to form a conical shape. When the outer surface of the conical shape is seated on the valve seat 24, the pressure limiter 6 is put in a closed valve state. On the top of the inlet side fuel hole 27 of the valve needle 23, a plunger portion 35 and a shaft shaped portion 36 are created as an integrated assembly. The plunger portion 35 has a diameter greater than that of the shaft shaped portion 37 and the shaft shaped portion 36 has a diameter than that of the plunger portion 35. One end of the spring 25 is held on the rear surface of the plunger portion 35 of the valve needle 23 and the other end is held on an end surface of the spring sheet 26. A force to open the valve of the pressure limiter 6 is determined by the sheet diameter of the valve needle 23 and the set weight of the spring 25. After the pressure limiter 6 is put in an opened valve state by a common rail pressure exceeding a limit setting pressure, the common rail pressure will drop to a level not higher than a predetermined pressure, and would naturally put the pressure limiter 6 in a closed valve state. In the case of this embodiment, however, the pressure limiter 6 is provided with a pressure regulating function. With this function, once the pressure limiter 6 is put in an opened valve state, the pressure limiter 6 is capable of controlling a pressure for closing the valve of the pressure limiter 6 so as to maintain the common rail pressure at a regulated pressure required to put the vehicle in a continued running state for the purpose of letting the vehicle enter a limp home state in the event of an emergency requiring an urgent rescue such as an excessive pressure feed of high-pressure fuel supplied by the high-pressure supply pump 3 to the common rail 4. In order to put the vehicle in a limp home state, it is necessary to put the vehicle in a continued running state by setting a fuel pressure for putting the vehicle in a continued running state at a level higher than an operating pressure of the injectors 2 so that fuel can be injected from the injectors 2 to the cylinders employed in the multi-cylinder engine 1, but at such a sufficiently low level that engine vibration, vehicle undesirable behaviors, a noise, a knocking sound and the like are not generated. Let this fuel pressure be referred to as a regulated pressure. This regulated pressure is determined by the diameter of the shaft shaped portion 37 of the valve needle 23 and the force of the spring 25 for pushing the valve needle 23 in a direction to close the valve of the pressure limiter 6. That is, the pressure to close the valve of the pressure limiter 6 is controlled proportionally to the square of the sheet diameter of the shaft shaped portion 37 of the valve needle 23. As described above, the sheet diameter determines the pressure to open the valve of the pressure limiter 6. The inlet metering valve 7 is electronically controlled by a control signal serving as a pump driving signal originated from the ECU 10 by way of a pump driving circuit (EDU) not shown in the figure to change a pressure in the common rail 4. The inlet metering valve 7 is used for adjusting the inlet volume of fuel inhaled into the pressure-applying chamber of the high-pressure supply pump 3. Referred to also as a common rail pressure, the pressure in the common rail 4 corresponds to an injection pressure or a fuel pressure at which fuel is supplied by injection from the injectors 2 to the multi-cylinder engine 1. The inlet metering valve 7 is an electromagnetic valve functioning as a pump flow control valve of the normally open type, which puts the inlet metering valve 7 in a completely open state when there is no current conduction. The ECU 10 comprises functional components such as a power supply circuit, an injector driving circuit and a pump driving circuit in addition to a microcomputer, which has a commonly known configuration including a CPU for executing various kinds of control and carrying out various kinds of processing, a ROM for storing a variety of programs and constants, a RAM for storing various kinds of data, an input circuit and an output circuit. Sensor signals generated by a variety of sensors are supplied to the microcomputer after being subjected to an A/D conversion process carried out in an A/D converter. Furthermore, the ECU 10 also includes an injection volume and injection timing determination means, an injection pulse width determination means and an injector driving means. The injection volume and injection timing determination means determines a target injection timing optimum for the operating state of the multi-cylinder engine 1 and determines a target injection volume of fuel injected from each of the injectors 2 to the multi-cylinder engine 1. The target injection timing may be indicated by an injection start timing. The target injection volume may be indicated by an injection period and the common rail pressure. The injection pulse width determination means determines an injector injection pulse's duration proper for the operating state of the multi-cylinder engine 1 and the target injection volume. The injector injection pulse's duration is the same as an injection pulse width. The injector driving means supply the injector injection pulse to an injection control valve employed in each of the injectors 2 by way of the injector driving circuit (EDU). That is, the ECU 10 computes a target injection volume on the basis of engine operating information such as an engine rotational speed detected by an engine speed sensor 41 and an accelerator position ACCP detected by an accelerator position sensor 42. The engine rotation speed is referred to hereafter as an engine speed NE. The ECU 10 supplies an injector injection pulse, which has an injection pulse width computed from the operating state of the multi-cylinder engine 1 and the target injection volume, to an injection control electromagnetic valve employed in the injector 2 of each cylinder. In this way, the multi-cylinder engine 1 is run. In addition, the ECU 10 also serves as a discharge volume control means for computing a target common rail pressure Pt corresponding to a fuel injection pressure proper for the operating state of the multi-cylinder engine 1 and for driving the inlet metering valve 7 of the high-pressure supply pump 3 through the pump driving circuit EDU. That is, the ECU 10 computes a target common rail pressure Pt by additional correction based on the engine operating information and an engine cooling water temperature THW detected by a cooling water temperature sensor 43. As described above, the engine operating information includes an engine speed NE detected by the engine speed sensor 41 and an accelerator position ACCP detected by the accelerator position sensor 42. The ECU 10 drives the inlet metering valve 7 of the high-pressure supply pump 3 in order to achieve the target common rail pressure Pt. Thus, this embodiment computes a target injection volume, an injection timing and a target common rail pressure by using the engine speed sensor 41, the accelerator position sensor 42 and the cooling water temperature sensor 43 as engine operating state detection means for detecting an engine operating state of the multi-cylinder engine 1. The target injection volume, the injection timing and the target common rail pressure may also be corrected on the basis of other engine operating information represented by detection signals generated by other sensors each also serving as an operating state detection means. The other sensors include an intake temperature sensor, a fuel temperature sensor 44, an intake pressure sensor, a cylinder identifying sensor and an injection timing sensor. In addition, it is desirable to further provide the common rail 4 with a common rail pressure sensor 45 used as a fuel pressure sensor for detecting an actual common rail pressure Pc, which is an actual fuel injection pressure required for supplying pressure by injection from the injector 2 of each cylinder to the multi-cylinder engine 1. It is also desirable to execute feedback control on the inlet metering valve 7 of the high-pressure supply pump 3 so as to take the actual common rail pressure Pc detected by the common rail pressure sensor 45 to a value all but equal to a target common rail pressure Pt, which is determined in accordance with the operating state of the multi-cylinder engine 1. In addition, the ECU 10 also includes an engine control means for executing idle up control to sustain an opened valve state of the valve needle 23 of the pressure limiter 6 by raising an idle rotation speed to a level not lower than a predetermined pressure when an abnormal increase in actual common rail pressure Pc caused by a failure of the inlet metering valve 7 of the high-pressure supply pump 3. The idle rotation speed is referred to hereafter as an idle revolution speed. CONTROL METHOD OF THE EMBODIMENT By referring to Figs. 1 to 4, the following description briefly explains a control method adopted by the embodiment implementing the common rail type fuel injection apparatus. Figs. 3 and 4 show a flowchart representing an outline of injection volume control provided by the present invention. The flowchart begins with a step S1 to input engine parameters representing an operating state of the multi-cylinder engine 1. The engine parameters include the engine speed NE, the accelerator position ACCP and the engine cooling water temperature THW. Then, the flow of the control goes on to a step S2 to determine whether the multi-cylinder engine 1 is in a stalled state. If the result of the determination is YES, indicating that the multi-cylinder engine 1 is in a stalled state, the flow of the control goes on to a step S3 at which an excessive pressure indication flag XPC is reset. The excessive pressure indication flag XPC may be referred to as a diagnosis flag. If the determination result obtained at the step S2 is NO, on the other hand, the flow of the control goes on to a step S4 to find a fuel injection volume Q with the engine parameters used as a base. Concretely, a fuel injection volume Q is found from the engine speed NE and the accelerator position ACCP. Then, at the next step S5, an injection time T is found with the engine parameters used as a base. Concretely, an injection time T is found from the fuel injection volume Q and the engine speed NE. Subsequently, the flow of the control goes on to a step S6 to determine whether the diagnosis flag XPC has been set. If the result of the determination is YES, indicating an excessive pressure abnormality, the flow of the control goes on directly to a step S15. If the determination result obtained at the step S6 is NO, on the other hand, the flow of the control goes on to a step S7 to find a target common rail pressure Pt with the engine parameters used as a base. Concretely, a target common rail pressure Pt is found from the fuel injection volume Q and the engine speed NE. Then, at the next step S8, a signal output by the common rail pressure sensor 45 is input. The signal represents an actual common rail pressure Pc as a detection value. Subsequently, the flow of the control goes on to a step S9 to find a control command value Duty of the inlet metering valve 7 for controlling the common rail voltage built up by the high-pressure supply pump 3 on the basis of a pressure deviation of the actual common rail pressure Pc from the target common rail pressure Pt. The pressure deviation may be expressed by (Pc - Pt). Then, at the next step S10, a basic idle revolution speed NFb is found from the engine cooling water temperature THW. Subsequently, the flow of the control goes on to a step S11 to determine whether the pressure deviation (Pc - Pt) is greater than a predetermined value \u03b1. If the result of the determination is YES, indicating that the pressure deviation (Pc - Pt) is greater than the predetermined value \u03b1, the flow of the control goes on to a step S12 to determine whether the state of the pressure deviation (Pc - Pt) greater than the predetermined value \u03b1 has been prevailing for at least a predetermined period of time such as 1 second. If the determination result obtained at the step S11 or S12 is NO, indicating that the pressure deviation (Pc - Pt) is not greater than the predetermined value \u03b1 or the state of the pressure deviation (Pc - Pt) smaller than the predetermined value \u03b1 has not been prevailing for at least the predetermined period of time respectively, on the other hand, the flow of the control goes on to a step S13 at which an idle target NF is set at the basic idle revolution speed NFb found from the engine cooling water temperature THW. If the determination result obtained at the step S12 is YES, indicating that the state of the pressure deviation (Pc - Pt) greater than the predetermined value \u03b1 has been prevailing for at least the predetermined period of time, on the other hand, an abnormality caused by an excessively large value of the pressure, that is, the fuel pressure or the common rail pressure determined to exist. In this case, the flow of the control goes on to a step S14 at which the diagnosis flag XPC is set. Then, at the next step S15, the idle target revolution speed NF is newly set at an abnormality value. That is, as an abnormality handling process, the idle target revolution speed NF is raised to (NFb + NFoff). The symbol NFb denotes the basic idle target revolution speed found at the step S10. The symbol NFoff denotes a predetermined value not smaller than typically 200 rpm to be added to the basic idle target revolution NFb in the event of such an abnormality. Subsequently, at the next step S16, a fuel injection volume correction quantity dQisc is found from a difference between the actual engine speed NE and a target value NF. Then, at the next step S17, the fuel injection volume correction quantity dQisc is added to a previous cumulative fuel injection volume correction quantity Qisc to give a current cumulative fuel injection volume correction quantity Qisc. Then, at the next step S18, the current cumulative fuel injection volume correction quantity Qisc is added to the fuel injection volume Q to give a final fuel injection volume Qfin. Subsequently, at the next step S19, an injection pulse duration Tq is computed from the actual common rail pressure Pc and the final fuel injection volume Qfin. The injection pulse duration is equal to an injection pulse width. Then, at the next step S20, an injector injection pulse with the injection pulse width Tq found at the step S19 is set at an output stage of the ECU 10. Subsequently, at the next step S21, the control command value Duty of the inlet metering valve 7 for controlling the common rail voltage is set at the output stage of the ECU 10. As described earlier, the control command value Duty was found at the step S9. The control described above is executed repeatedly. CHARACTERISTICS OF THE EMBODIMENT In the embodiment, a completely opened state abnormality of the inlet metering valve 7 in an idle operation is detected by the ECU 10 as shown in timing charts of Fig. 7 as an excessively high pressure abnormality caused by a state in which a pressure deviation (Pc - Pt) of the actual common rail pressure Pc from the target common rail pressure Pt exceeds a predetermined value due to high-pressure fuel excessively pressure fed by the high-pressure supply pump 3 to the common rail 4, that is, a state in which the common rail pressure Pc is higher than a pressure abnormality detection level has been prevailing for at least a predetermined period of time. Then, as the actual common rail pressure Pc increases to a level above a limit setting pressure, the shaft shaped portion 37 of the valve needle 23 employed in the pressure limiter 6 is lifted from the valve seat 24. The pressure limiter 6 is switched into an opened valve state to discharge high-pressure fuel from the common rail 4 to the fuel tank 9. The fuel tank 9 is a part of -the low-pressure side component in the system. The high-pressure fuel is discharged through the valve hole 22, the inlet side fuel hole 27, the fuel hole 28, the small diameter hole 29, the outlet side fuel hole 30 and the leak pipe 14. The leak pipe 14 is a part of the low-pressure side. As a result, the pressure of fuel in the high-pressure route is suppressed to a level not higher than the limit setting pressure. The limit setting pressure is also referred to as an open pressure for the pressure limiter valve. The high-pressure route comprises the common rail 4, the branch pipe 15 and the fuel pipe 16. The branch pipe 15 and the fuel pipe 16 are parts of a high-pressure pipe. When the multi-cylinder engine 1 is operated at a normal idle revolution speed resulting in a small amount of fuel discharged by the high-pressure supply pump 3 to the common rail 4, however, the valve needle 23 employed in the pressure limiter 6 is not capable of sustaining an opened valve state so that the common rail pressure Pc decreases to the pressure limiter valve closing level, causing the valve needle 23 employed in the pressure limiter 6 to be seated on the valve seat 24. The amount of fuel discharged by the high-pressure supply pump 3 to the common rail 4 is referred to as a supplied fuel volume. With the valve needle 23 seated on the valve seat 24, the pressure limiter 6 is put in a closed valve state, causing fuel discharged thereafter by the high-pressure supply pump 3 to the common rail 4 to be accumulated in the common rail 4. As a result, since the common rail pressure Pc again exceeds the limit setting pressure, the pressure limiter 6 reenters an opened valve state. Thereafter, the common rail pressure Pc decreases to the pressure limiter valve closing level and again increases to a level higher than the limit setting pressure repeatedly in an alternate manner as such so that the valve needle 23 employed in the pressure limiter 6 is repeatedly put in a closed valve state and an opened valve state also in an alternate manner. As a result, the idle performance of the multi-cylinder engine 1 becomes instable and, in addition, the increased number of times the valve needle 23 employed in the pressure limiter 6 enters an opened valve state and a closed valve state alternately causes fatigue of the spring 25 employed in the pressure limiter 6 and a bad seal on the seal sheet surface, raising a problem of impossibility to assure reliability of the pressure limiter 6. Thus, in order to solve the above problem, in the common rail type fuel injection apparatus implemented by this embodiment, when an abnormal increase in pressure is detected, the target idle revolution speed is raised to at least a value for the steady state or the normal value as shown in Figs. 5 and 6. That is, the idle revolution speed is newly set at an abnormal value greater than a normal value for the idle state in the so-called idle revolution speed up operation. Thus, it is possible to prevent the valve needle 23 employed in the pressure limiter 6 from entering a closed valve state from an opened valve state of the pressure limiter 6, which has been once put in the opened valve state by the common rail pressure Pc exceeding the limit setting pressure due to the improved discharging performance of the high-pressure supply pump 3 driven by the multi-cylinder engine 1 into rotation. As a result, the idle performance of the multi-cylinder engine 1 can be prevented from becoming instable due to an increased number of times the valve needle 23 employed in the pressure limiter 6 enters an opened valve state and a closed valve state repeatedly, and the reliability of the pressure limiter 6 can be assured. In addition, if the inlet metering valve 7 provided at the inlet of the high-pressure supply pump 3 is an electromagnetic valve of the normally closed type, a breakage or a short circuit of a wiring harness connecting a pump driving circuit EDU to the inlet metering valve 7 results in no fuel discharged from the high-pressure supply pump 3 so that it is impossible to sustain a common rail type fuel pressure and a fuel injection volume, that are required to operate the multi-cylinder engine 1. As a result, there is raised a problem called an engine stall. In the case of this embodiment in which an electromagnetic valve of the normally open type is employed as the inlet metering valve 7, on the contrary, a breakage or a short circuit of the wiring harness connecting the pump driving circuit EDU to the inlet metering valve 7 results in a completely opened state abnormality of the inlet metering valve 7. This abnormality in turn causes an excessive pressure feed of the high-pressure supply pump 3. That is, the abnormality causes a full discharge volume of the high-pressure supply pump 3. Thus, as the actual common rail pressure Pc increases to a level above the limit setting pressure, the valve needle 23 employed in the pressure limiter 6 is put in an opened valve state, letting high-pressure fuel flow to the low-pressure side as described above so that the actual common rail pressure Pc again decreases to a level below the limit setting pressure. By combining the inlet metering valve 7 of the normally open type with the pressure limiter 6 having a pressure regulating function, however, once the valve needle 23 employed in the pressure limiter 6 is put in an opened valve state, the fuel injection pressure and the common rail pressure can be maintained at a regulated level required for putting the vehicle in a limp home state in the event of an emergency requiring an urgent rescue. As a result, an engine stall can be avoided and a limp home quality can be improved. MODIFIED EMBODIMENTS In this embodiment, the common rail pressure sensor 45 is provided directly on the common rail 4 to be used for detecting an actual common rail pressure, that is, a pressure of fuel in the common rail 4. As an alternative, a fuel pressure detection means can also be provided typically on a fuel pipe between the plunger chamber of the high-pressure supply pump 3 and fuel routes in the injectors 2 to be used for detecting a pressure of fuel discharged from the pressurizing chamber of the high-pressure supply pump 3. In this embodiment, the inlet metering valve 7 is provided for changing or adjusting the intake volume of fuel absorbed to the plunger chamber of the high-pressure supply pump 3. As an alternative, a discharged fuel metering valve can also be provided for changing or adjusting the volume of fuel discharged from the plunger chamber of the high-pressure supply pump 3 to the common rail 4. Referring to FIG. 1, a discharged fuel metering valve 7a may be disposed on an outlet side of the high-pressure supply pump 3 instead of the inlet metering valve 7. This embodiment employs an electromagnetic valve of the normally open type fully opening the valve in a state of no current conduction as the inlet metering valve or the discharged fuel metering valve. As an alternative, an electromagnetic valve of the normally closed type fully closing the valve in a state of no current conduction can also be employed as the inlet metering valve or the discharged fuel metering valve. In this case, a completely open state abnormality of the discharged fuel metering valve or the inlet metering valve, that is, an excessive pressure feed of high-pressure fuel supplied by the supply pump 3 to the accumulator of the common rail 4 or an abnormal pressure increase detected in the accumulator of the common rail 4, can be considered to be a state caused by an abnormality of an excessively large control voltage generated by the ECU 10 or the pump driving circuit EDU. SECOND EMBODIMENT A second embodiment of the present invention is explained by referring to the drawings. The second embodiment has the same configuration as the first embodiment as shown in Fig. 1. The same reference numbers are used in the second embodiment. In addition to the first embodiment, in the second embodiment, the ECU 10 also includes an operating state detection means for detecting an operating state of the supply pump 3. This operating state detection means also serves as a pressure fed volume determination means for computing a pressure fed volume of fuel discharged by the supply pump 3 to the common rail 4 from an operating state of the engine 1, the degree of opening SCVK of the inlet metering valve 7 and an actual common rail pressure Pc. An example of the operating state of the engine 1 in this computation is the engine speed NE. The pressure fed volume of fuel discharged by the supply pump 3 is also referred to as a pump pressure fed volume. Furthermore, the ECU 10 also includes a leak quantity determination means for computing the quantity QL of a fuel leak from the high-pressure pipe route based on an operating state of the engine 1, a target injection volume Q and an actual common rail pressure Pc. The high-pressure pipe route includes passages extending from the supply pump 3 to the injectors 2 through the common rail 4. An example of the operating state of the engine 1 in this computation is the engine speed NE. Moreover, the ECU 10 also includes a leakage quantity finding means for computing the quantity Qo of a fuel leakage from the high-pressure pipe route based on an operating state of the engine 1, a pump pressure fed volume Qp and a fuel leak quantity QL. An example of the operating state of the engine 1 in this computation is the engine speed NE. In addition, the ECU 10 also includes an engine control means for taking failsafe measures such as an action to limit the output of the engine 1 and a measure to stop the engine 1 in accordance with the level of a fuel leakage. The engine control means has a first fuel leakage determination means for determining that a detected fuel leakage quantity Qo smaller than a first predetermined value \u03b1 is a quantity of a normal fuel leakage from the high-pressure pipe route. The engine 1 is controlled normally even if the first fuel leakage determination means detects a quantity of a normal fuel leak. Furthermore, the engine control means has a second fuel leakage determination means for determining that a detected fuel leakage quantity Qo greater than the first predetermined value \u03b1 but not exceeding a second predetermined value \u03b2 is a quantity of a small fuel leakage from the high-pressure pipe route. A failsafe measure such as an action to limit the output of the engine 1 is taken to let the vehicle continue its running state for the purpose of implementing limp home running of the vehicle if the first fuel leakage determination means detects a quantity of a small fuel leakage. Moreover, the engine control means has a third fuel leakage determination means for determining that a detected fuel leakage quantity Qo smaller than the second predetermined value \u03b2 is a quantity of a large fuel leakage from the high-pressure pipe route. A failsafe measure such as an action to stop the engine 1 is taken to raise the degree of safety of the vehicle if the first fuel leakage determination means detects a quantity of a large fuel leakage. It is to be noted that, in this embodiment, a failsafe measure such as an action to limit the output of the engine 1 is taken to let the vehicle continue its running state for the purpose of implementing limp home running of the vehicle even if the first fuel leakage determination means detects a quantity of a large fuel leakage provided that an actual common rail pressure Pc exceeds a predetermined pressure level Pm as will be described later. In addition, the engine control means has a pressure-drop or excessive-pressure-feed detection means for detecting a pressure drop caused by an opened valve state of the pressure limiter 6 or an excessive pressure feed state of the supply pump 3 for a case in which a fuel leakage quantity Qo is greater than the second predetermined value \u03b2 and an actual common rail pressure Pc is higher than the predetermined pressure level Pm. When this pressure-drop or excessive-pressure-feed detection means detects a pressure drop caused by an opened valve state of the pressure limiter 6 or an excessive pressure feed state of the supply pump 3, a failsafe measure such as an action to limit the output of the engine 1 is taken to let the vehicle continue its running state for the purpose of implementing limp home running of the vehicle. Furthermore, the engine control means has a system abnormality detection means for detecting the high-pressure pipe route's abnormality such as a burst of a high-pressure pipe for a case in which a fuel leakage quantity Qo is greater than the second predetermined value \u03b2 and an actual common rail pressure Pc is not higher than the predetermined pressure level Pm. When this system abnormality detection means detects an abnormality of the high-pressure pipe route, a failsafe measure such as an action to stop the engine 1 is taken to raise the degree of safety of the vehicle. CONTROL METHOD OF THE EMBODIMENT Next, a control method adopted by the common rail fuel injection system implemented by the embodiment is explained in a simple way by referring to Figs. 8 to 10. Fig. 8 shows a flowchart representing a subroutine for setting an abnormally high pressure history storing flag. Figs. 9 and 10 show a flowchart representing the control method of the common rail fuel injection system provided by the present invention. When an ignition key is turned on, the subroutine shown in Fig. 8 is activated. The subroutine shown in Fig. 8 is also activated at predetermined intervals such as an interval in the range 10 to 40 degrees CA (crank angle). It is to be noted that an abnormally high pressure history storing flag XPCMEM is reset to 0 or set initially when the ignition key is turned on from an OFF state. It is also worth noting that the subroutine shown in Fig. 8 can also be activated when the engine is in a stopped state or after the lapse of a predetermined time such as 10 seconds. The flowchart begins with a step S101 to input an actual common rail pressure Pc, which is represented by a detection signal generated by the common rail pressure sensor 45. Then, the flow of the routine goes on to a step S102 to determine whether the actual common rail pressure Pc exceeds a predetermined pressure level Pm in a typical range of 150 to 155 MPa. If the result of the determination is NO, that is, if the actual common rail pressure Pc is not higher than the predetermined pressure level Pm, the subroutine is executed repeatedly at the predetermined intervals starting with the step S101. If the determination result obtained at the step S102 is YES, that is, if the actual common rail pressure Pc is higher than the predetermined pressure level Pm, on the other hand, the flow of the subroutine goes on to a step S103 at which the abnormally high pressure history storing flag XPCMEM is set at 1. Then, the subroutine is executed repeatedly at the predetermined intervals starting with the step S101. It is to be noted that the abnormally high pressure history storing flag XPCMEM set at 1 indicates that it is quite within the bounds of possibility that there is an excessive-pressure-feed (or a full pressure fed volume) state of the supply pump 3, a fuel escape (or a pressure drop) caused by an opened valve state of the pressure limiter 6 or the like. In this case, a failsafe measure such as an action to limit the output of the engine 1 is taken to let the vehicle continue its running state for the purpose of implementing limp home running of the vehicle. In addition, when an ignition key is turned on, the subroutine shown in Figs. 9 and 10 is activated. The flowchart begins with a step S111 to input engine parameters representing an operating state of the engine 1. The engine parameters include the engine speed NE, the accelerator position ACCP, the engine cooling water temperature THW and the fuel temperature Qt. Moreover, for feedback control of the pressure fed volume of the supply pump 3, that is, for feedback control of the opening degree SCVK of the inlet metering valve 7, an opening degree SCVK of the inlet metering valve 7 is also fetched at the same step. Furthermore, at this step, an actual common rail pressure Pc is also read in from the common rail pressure sensor 45. Then, at the next step S112, engine control command variables are found with the engine parameters used as a base. Concretely, a target injection volume Q is found from the engine speed NE and the accelerator position ACCP. Then, a target common rail pressure Pt is computed from the engine speed NE and the target injection volume Q. Finally, an injection timing is determined also from the engine speed NE and the target injection volume Q. Subsequently, at the next step S113, a pump pressure fed volume Qp representing a pressure fed volume of fuel discharged from the supply pump 3 to the common rail 4 is found with the engine parameters used as a base. Concretely, a pump pressure fed volume Qp is computed from the engine speed NE, the pump opening degree SCVK representing the degree of opening at the inlet metering valve 7 and the actual common rail pressure Pc. Then, at the next step S114, a quantity QL of a fuel leak from the high-pressure pipe route is found with the engine parameters used as a base. Concretely, a fuel leak quantity QL is computed from the engine speed NE, the target injection volume Q, the actual common rail pressure Pc and the fuel temperature Qt. Subsequently, at the next step S115, a quantity Qo of a fuel leakage from the high-pressure pipe route is found with the engine parameters used as a base. Concretely, a fuel leakage quantity Qo is computed from the pump pressure fed volume Qp, the target injection volume Q and the fuel leak quantity QL. Then, the flow of the routine goes on to a step S116 to determine whether the fuel leakage quantity Qo computed at the step S115 is greater than a first predetermined value \u03b1 such as typically 20mm 3 /st. If the result of the determination is NO, that is, if the fuel leakage quantity Qo is not greater than the first predetermined value \u03b1, a normal fuel leakage such as a small fuel leakage from the high-pressure pipe route is determined to exist. In this case, the flow of the subroutine goes on to a step S117 at which a PL opened flag abnormality determination flag fPL is reset to 0. The PL opened flag abnormality determination flag fPL is used to indicate whether or not an excessive-pressure-feed (or a full pressure fed volume) state of the supply pump 3 exists. Subsequently, at the next step S118, a small fuel leakage abnormality flag fLS and a large fuel leakage abnormality flag fLB are reset to 0. The small fuel leakage abnormality flag fLS is used to indicate whether or not a small quantity of a fuel leakage from the high-pressure pipe route exists. On the other hand, the large fuel leakage abnormality flag fLB is used to indicate whether or not a large quantity of a fuel leakage from the high-pressure pipe route exists. Then, the flow of the subroutine goes on to a step S119 to find a pump control command variable, which is a value of a control command to be output to the inlet metering valve 7 of the supply pump 3. Concretely, a value of a control command to be output to the inlet metering valve 7 of the supply pump 3 is computed from a pressure difference (Pc - Pt) between the actual common rail pressure Pc and the target common rail pressure Pt. This computed pump control command variable is used as a signal duty ratio dDuty. This computed pump control command variable dDuty is then added to an existing cumulative pump control command variable \u03a3D to give a current cumulative pump control command variable \u03a3D. Subsequently, at the next step S120, an injection pulse duration or an injection pulse width Tq of an injector pulse signal supplied to the injectors 2 is found. Concretely, an injection pulse width Tq is found from the engine speed NE and the target injection volume Q or a corrected injection volume, which is a final injection volume Q obtained as a result of correction of the target injection volume Q as will be described later. Then, at the next step S121, the injector injection pulse signal is set at an output stage of the ECU 10. The injector injection pulse signal has a pulse width equal to the injection pulse width Tq found at the step S120. Subsequently, at the next step S122, the current cumulative pump control command variable \u03a3D is set at an output stage of the ECU 10. The current cumulative pump control command variable \u03a3D has been found at the step S119. Thereafter, the subroutine is executed from the beginning to repeat the above control. If the determination result obtained at the step S116 is YES, that is, if the fuel leakage quantity Qo is greater than the first predetermined value \u03b1, on the other hand, the flow of the subroutine goes on to a step S123 to determine whether the fuel leakage quantity Qo is greater than a second predetermined value \u03b2 such as typically 40mm 3 /st. If the result of the determination is NO, that is, if the fuel leakage quantity Qo is greater than the first predetermined value\u03b1 but not greater than the second predetermined value \u03b2, a small quantity fuel leakage from the high-pressure pipe route instead of a fuel escape caused by an opened valve state of the pressure limiter 6 is determined to exist. In this case, the flow of the subroutine goes on to a step S124 at which the small fuel leakage abnormality flag fLS is set at 1. Then, at the next step S125, engine limit command variables (or output limit values) for limiting the outputs of the engine 1 are found with the engine parameters used as a base. Concretely, a corrected injection volume QPL, a corrected common rail pressure PtPL and a corrected injection timing TPL are found from the engine speed NE. Subsequently, at the next step S126, a final injection volume Q, a final common rail pressure Pt and a final injection timing T are found, where a final value is the smaller one of a base value found at the step S112 and a corrected value computed at the step S125. Then, the flow of the subroutine goes on to the step S119. If the determination result obtained at the step S123 is YES, that is, if the fuel leakage quantity Qo is greater than the second predetermined value \u03b2, on the other hand, a fuel escape or a large fuel leakage from the high-pressure pipe route is determined to exist. The fuel escape is caused by an opened valve state or a valve opening operation of the pressure limiter 6. The system abnormality includes an abnormal failure of the high-pressure pipe route. An opened valve state or a valve opening operation of the pressure limiter 6 is caused by an excessive pressure feed of the supply pump 3. An example of the abnormal failure of the high-pressure pipe route is a burst of a high-pressure pipe. In this case, the flow of the subroutine goes on to a step S127 to determine whether the abnormally high pressure history storing flag XPCMEM has been set at 1, that is, whether the actual common rail pressure Pc is higher than the predetermined pressure level Pm. If the result of the determination is YES, that is, if the abnormally high pressure history storing flag XPCMEM has been set at 1, a fuel escape caused by an opened state of the pressure limiter 6 is determined to exist. As described above, an opened valve state of the pressure limiter 6 is caused by an excessive pressure feed of the supply pump 3. In this case, the flow of the subroutine goes on to a step S28 at which the PL opened flag abnormality determination flag fPL is set at 1. Then, the flow of the subroutine goes on to a step S125 at which a failsafe measure such as an action to limit the output of the engine 1 is taken to let the vehicle continue its running state for the purpose of implementing limp home running of the vehicle. If the determination result obtained at the step S127 is NO, that is, if the abnormally high pressure history storing flag XPCMEM has been reset to 0, on the other hand, a system abnormality is determined to exist. The system abnormality includes an abnormal failure of the high-pressure pipe route. An example of the abnormal failure of the high-pressure pipe route is a burst of a high-pressure pipe. In this case, the flow of the subroutine goes on to a step S129 at which the large fuel leakage abnormality flag fLB is set at 1 and a failsafe measure such as an action to stop the engine 1 is taken for the purpose of raising the degree of safety of the vehicle. Then, the flow of the subroutine goes on to a step S130 at which engine stop control variables are set. Concretely, the target injection volume Q is set at 0 and a pump control command variable (or the duty ratio \u03a3D) is set at 100%. That is, the pump control command variable is set at a value for completely closing the inlet metering valve 7. Subsequently, the flow of the subroutine goes on to a step S120 at which the injection pulse width Tq is set at 0. Then, the flow of the subroutine goes on to a step S121. The small fuel leakage abnormality flag fLS set at 1 at the step S124 to indicate a small fuel leakage from the high-pressure pipe route, the PL opened flag abnormality determination flag fPL set at 1 at the step S128 to indicate an opened valve state abnormality of the pressure limiter 6 as well as indicate an excessive pressure feed (a full pressure fed volume) of the supply pump 3 and the large fuel leakage abnormality flag fLB set at 1 at the step S129 to indicate a large fuel leakage from the high-pressure pipe route can each be shown separately by a display means as well. An example of the display mean is an indicator lamp or an audio guide. As described above, a large fuel leakage from the high-pressure pipe route is caused by a system abnormality including an abnormal failure of the high-pressure pipe route. An example of the abnormal failure of the high-pressure pipe route is a burst of a high-pressure pipe. CHARACTERISTICS OF THE EMBODIMENT If an electromagnetic valve of the normally closed type is employed as the inlet metering valve 7 provided on the inlet side of the supply pump 3, a breakage of a wiring harness connecting the inlet metering valve 7 to the pump driving circuit will result in no discharge of fuel, making it impossible to sustain a common rail pressure required for operating the engine 1. As a result, an engine stall is generated. Even if an electromagnetic valve of the normally closed type is employed as the inlet metering valve 7, a foreign material inadvertently caught between the valve body and the valve seat of the inlet metering valve 7 will mechanically put the inlet metering valve 7 in a completely but abnormally opened state. In addition, if an electromagnetic valve of the normally open type is employed as the inlet metering valve 7 as is the case with this embodiment, a breakage of a wiring harness connecting the inlet metering valve 7 to the pump driving circuit (EDU), a control abnormality of the ECU 10 or the like will electrically put the inlet metering valve 7 in a completely but abnormally opened state. Furthermore, if an electromagnetic valve of the normally open type is employed as the inlet metering valve 7, a foreign material inadvertently caught between the valve body and the valve seat of the inlet metering valve 7 will mechanically put the inlet metering valve 7 in a completely but abnormally opened state as well. With the inlet metering valve 7 put in a completely but abnormally opened state as such, the supply pump 3 will generate an excessive pressure feed or a full pressure fed volume as shown in timing charts of Figs. 11 and 12. Then, with the supply pump 3 generating an excessive pressure feed or a full pressure fed volume, the common rail pressure rises. When the actual common rail pressure Pc exceeds the pressure limiter detection level, that is, the predetermined pressure level Pm, the abnormally high pressure history storing flag XPCMEM is set at 1. As the actual common rail pressure Pc further exceeds a limit setting pressure or a pressure limiter valve opening pressure, the pressure limiter 6 is put in an opened valve state, flowing high-pressure fuel from the common rail 4 to the fuel tank 9 on the low-pressure side by way of the leak pipe 14, which is a portion of the low-pressure pipe route. As a result, the fuel pressure of the high-pressure pipe route including the common rail 4 and the fuel pipe 16 can be suppressed to a level not exceeding the limit setting pressure. It is to be noted that, at a low engine speed resulting in a small volume (a small flow) of fuel discharged (supplied) from the supply pump 3 to the common rail 4, the pressure limiter 6 is not capable of sustaining its opened valve state and thus enters a closed valve state as shown in the timing chart of Fig. 12. This is because the actual common rail pressure Pc decreases to a level that causes the pressure limiter 6 to enter a closed valve state. With the pressure limiter 6 put in a closed valve state, fuel discharged thereafter from the supply pump 3 to the common rail 4 is stored in the common rail 4, causing the actual common rail pressure Pc to re-exceed the limit setting pressure, which drives the pressure limiter 6 to enter an opened valve state. Thereafter, the pressure limiter 6 repeatedly enters a closed valve state and an opened valve state alternately. With the abnormally high pressure history storing flag XPCMEM set at 1 to indicate that the actual common rail pressure Pc is higher than the pressure limiter detection pressure level Pm, the ECU 10 is capable of determining that the leakage detection logic is detecting a fuel escape caused by an opened valve state (or a valve opening operation) of the pressure limiter 6 in the so-called a PL operation detection. With the abnormally high pressure history storing flag XPCMEM reset to 0 to indicate that the actual common rail pressure Pc is not higher than the pressure limiter detection pressure level Pm, on the other hand, the ECU 10 is capable of determining whether a fuel leakage is very small (normal), small or large in dependence on the level of the fuel leakage. Thus, if the inlet metering valve 7 is electrically or mechanically put in a completely but abnormally opened state, causing the supply pump 3 to generate an excessive pressure feed or a full pressure fed volume, causing the fuel pressure in the high-pressure pipe route to exceed the limit setting level, causing the pressure limiter 6 to enter an opened valve state, resulting in a determination of a large fuel escape, a failsafe measure such as an action to limit the output of the engine 1 can be taken to let the vehicle continue its running state for the purpose of implementing limp home running of the vehicle by avoidance of a stalled engine state. Thus, a fuel escape caused by a valve opening operation (or an opened valve state) of the pressure limiter 6 can be distinguished from a fuel leakage caused by the high-pressure pipe route's abnormal failure such as a burst of a high-pressure pipe. In addition, a pressure decrease caused by a valve opening operation (or an opened valve state) of the pressure limiter 6 can be distinguished from a variation in pressure level so that such a decrease in pressure can be separated from a leakage criterion item. Accordingly, a failsafe measure taken for such a fuel escape or such a decrease in pressure can be implemented differently from a failsafe measure taken for a fuel leakage caused by the high-pressure pipe route's abnormal failure such as a burst of a high-pressure pipe. As a result, it is possible to substantially increase the common rail fuel injection system's degree of reliability and degree of safety. In addition, if the fuel leakage quantity Qo computed on the basis of the pump pressure fed volume Qp, the target injection volume Q and the fuel leak quantity QL is found greater than the first predetermined value \u03b1 but not greater than the second predetermined value \u03b2, the ECU 10 confirms existence of not only a fuel escape caused by an opened valve state of the pressure limiter 6 but also a small fuel leakage from the high-pressure pipe route. In this case, a failsafe measure such as an action to limit the output of the engine 1 is taken. Furthermore, even if the fuel leakage quantity Qo computed on the basis of the pump pressure fed volume Qp, the target injection volume Q and the fuel leak quantity QL is found greater than the second predetermined value \u03b2, the ECU 10 determines that a large fuel leakage from the high-pressure pipe route exists due to a system abnormality including the high-pressure pipe route's abnormal failure such as a burst of a high-pressure pipe provided that the actual common rail pressure Pc is not higher than the pressure limiter detection pressure level Pm. In this case, a failsafe measure such as an action to stop the engine 1 is taken to avoid dangers. In this way, in accordance with the level of the fuel leakage quantity Qo, the state of the engine 1 is controlled by taking a failsafe measure such as an action to stop the engine 1 or a failsafe measure such as an action to limit the output of the engine 1 to implement limp home running of the vehicle. As a result, it is possible to substantially increase the common rail fuel injection system's degree of reliability and degree of safety. MODIFIED EMBODIMENTS In this embodiment, the common rail pressure sensor 45 is directly installed on the common rail 4 to be used for detecting an actual common rail pressure, that is, a fuel pressure built up in the common rail 4. As an alternative, a fuel pressure detection means can be provided typically on a fuel pipe between the plunger chamber (or the pressure-applying chamber) of the supply pump 3 and fuel routes in the injectors 2 to be used for detecting a pressure of fuel discharged from the pressure-applying chamber of the supply pump 3. In this embodiment, the inlet metering valve 7 is provided for changing or adjusting the intake volume of fuel absorbed to the pressure-applying chamber of the supply pump 3. As an alternative, a discharge metering electromagnetic valve can be provided for changing or adjusting the volume of fuel discharged from the pressure-applying chamber of the supply pump 3 to the common rail 4. In this embodiment, the discharge fuel metering electromagnetic valve or the inlet metering electromagnetic valve is a magnetic valve of the normally open type, which puts the valve in a completely open state when no current is supplied to the valve. As an alternative, the discharge fuel metering electromagnetic valve or the inlet metering electromagnetic valve can be a magnetic valve of the normally closed type, which puts the valve in a completely open state when a current is supplied to the valve. In this case, a completely but abnormally open state of the discharge fuel metering electromagnetic valve or the inlet metering electromagnetic valve, that is, an excessive pressure feed of high-pressure fuel supplied by the supply pump 3 to the accumulator of the common rail 4 or an abnormal pressure increase detected in the accumulator of the common rail 4, can be considered to be a state caused by an excessive abnormality of a control voltage generated by the ECU 10 or the pump driving circuit EDU. This embodiment employs the pressure limiter 6 that enters a closed valve state when the pressure of fuel in the high-pressure pipe route decreases to a level not higher than a valve closing pressure. As an alternative, it is possible to employ a pressure limiter having a pressure regulating function capable of letting the vehicle continue its running state safely. To put it in detail, even at a low engine speed, once such a pressure limiter is put in an opened valve state, the pressure limiter is capable of sustaining the pressure of fuel in the high-pressure pipe route at a regulated level, that is, a level typically higher than the operating pressure of the injectors 2 but lower than a pressure that would result in engine vibrations and/or undesirable operations of the vehicle. In this embodiment, the predetermined pressure level Pm serving as a criterion for determining an abnormally high pressure of fuel in the high-pressure pipe route is set at a value greater than the upper limit of a pressure range normally used in the common rail fuel injection system but smaller than the value of a pressure to put the pressure limiter 6 in an opened valve state. The upper limit is a pressure of typically 145 MPa whereas the pressure to put the pressure limiter 6 in an opened valve state is the so-called limit setting pressure, which has a typical value of 160 MPa. Thus, the predetermined pressure level Pm is set at a pressure typically in the range 150 to 155 MPa. As an alternative, the predetermined pressure level Pm serving as a criterion for determining an abnormally high pressure of fuel in the high-pressure pipe route is set at a value varying within a typical range of \u00b1 5MPa in dependence of the output characteristic of the common rail pressure sensor 45 and the valve opening characteristic of the pressure limiter 6, which vary from vehicle to vehicle or from engine to engine. In this case, the most desirable predetermined pressure level Pm is 155 MPa. Further, the idle up control in the abnormal state described in the first embodiment may be combined with the second embodiment so that the common rail pressure is maintained in constant even in the limp home operation. Although the present invention has been described in connection with the preferred embodiments thereof with reference to the accompanying drawings, it is to be noted that various changes and modifications will be apparent to those skilled in the art. Such changes and modifications are to be understood as being included within the scope of the present invention as defined in the appended claims. An excessive volume of fuel discharged by a high-pressure supply pump (3) to a common rail (4) due to an opened state abnormality of an inlet metering valve (7) may result in an abnormal increase in common rail pressure. In the event of such an abnormal increase, a target idle revolution speed is newly set at an abnormal value greater than a normal value as a measure taken to increase an idle revolution speed. Thus, a pressure limiter (6), which has been once put in an opened valve state by an actual common rail pressure higher than a limit setting pressure, can be prevented from again entering a closed valve state. As a result, it is possible to eliminate idle performance instability caused by repetition of opened valve and closed valve states of the pressure limiter and, hence, assure reliability of the pressure limiter.", "tags": ["F02M", "F02D"]}
{"_id": "EP1731500A1", "docid": "EP1731500A1", "title": "5-AMINOLEVULINIC ACID SALT, PROCESS FOR PRODUCING THE SAME AND USE THEREOF", "text": "TECHNICAL FIELD The present invention relates to a 5-aminolevulinic acid salt which is useful in fields of microorganisms, fermentation, animals, medicaments, plants and the like; a process for producing the same; a medical composition comprising the same; and a plant activator composition comprising the same. BACKGROUND ART It is known that 5-aminolevulinic acid is useful for VB 12 production, heme enzyme production, microbial culturing, porphyrin production and the like in the field of microbial fermentation, for infectious disease treatment (Non-patent Reference 1), sterilization, Haemophilus diagnosis, derivative materials, depilation, rheumatism therapy (Non-patent Reference 2), cancer therapy (Non-patent Reference 3), thrombus therapy (Non-patent Reference 4), diagnosis during cancer operation (Non-patent Reference 5), animal cell culture, UV cut, heme metabolism research, hair care, diagnosis of heavy metal toxication and porphyria, anemia prevention and the like in the field of animal therapy, and for agricultural chemicals and the like in the field of plants. On the other hand, production method of 5-aminolevulinic acid is known only as its hydrochloride, and methods which use hippuric acid (Patent Reference 1), succinic acid monoester chloride (Patent Reference 2), furfurylamine (Patent Reference 3), hydroxymethylfufural (Patent Reference 4), oxovaleric acid methyl ester (Patent Reference 5) or succinic anhydride (Patent Reference 6) as the material have been reported. However, since the 5-aminolevulinic acid hydrochloride contains hydrochloric acid, it is necessary to take into consideration corrosion of the apparatus and generation of a stimulation caused by the hydrogen chloride vaporized during the production process and compounding and dispersing process, so that it is preferable to take a countermeasure for preventing these. Also, in the case of oral administration of 5-aminolevulinic acid hydrochloride or its application to the skin in human, a scorching stimulation is added to the tongue or skin. Accordingly, concern has been directed toward a 5-aminolevulinic acid salt having smaller stimulation than that of 5-aminolevulinic acid hydrochloride, as the 5-aminolevulinic acid to be used in the field of medicines. In addition, since 5-aminolevulinic acid hydrochloride has a property to partially degrade at from 130 to 156\u00b0C and completely degrade at 156\u00b0C, it has a problem of hardly able to withstand high temperature heat sterilization treatment. A sterilization method by radiation exposure is known as a method for solving this problem (Patent Reference 7), but this method requires a radiation exposure apparatus. Accordingly, in order to carry out sterilization by a general and convenient heat sterilization method, it is necessary to improve heat resistance of 5-aminolevulinic acid. In addition, although 5-aminolevulinic acid hydrochloride is used in the field of plants (Patent Reference 8), when used by mixing with silver nitrate or the like bactericide component generally used for plants, precipitation of silver chloride is generated in some cases through the reaction of 5-aminolevulinic acid hydrochloride with silver nitrate, which requires great care from the operational point of view because of a possibility of disabling spraying of the agent due to clogging of the sprayer nozzle. Also, when an aqueous 5-aminolevulinic acid hydrochloride solution is directly applied to a fruit, coloring of the fruit sometimes becomes insufficient when chloride ion is present. In addition, although an aqueous solution containing 5-aminolevulinic acid ion and nitrate ion has been suggested, 5-aminolevulinic acid nitrate has not been isolated yet (Non-patent Reference 6).

Effect of the Invention The 5-aminolevulinic acid salt of the present invention is a substance which is easy to handle, because it does not give off an offensive odor or a stimulative odor.

Still more, this has a high decomposition point and a high heat resistance in comparison with its hydrochloride. According to the production method of the present invention, a 5-aminolevulinic acid salt can be produced conveniently and efficiently.

In addition, it is excellent in its permeability into the animal skin and plant epidermis. Accordingly, similar to the case of 5-aminolevulinic acid hydrochloride, a 5-aminolevulinic acid salt, preferably 5-aminolevulinic acid phosphate, is useful as an agent for photodynamic treatment or photodynamic diagnosis in animals including human. As the agent for photodynamic treatment or diagnosis, agents for the photodynamic treatment or diagnosis of cancer, infectious disease, rheumatism, thrombus, pimple and the like can be exemplified.

In addition, when the 5-aminolevulinic acid salt is used, for example in plant applications, it may contain a generally used fertilizer component and the like. As the fertilizer component, the substances disclosed in JP-A-4-338305 ( U.S. Patent 5,298,482 , EP-A-0514776 ) can be exemplified. The 5-aminolevulinic acid salt is also useful as a plant activator.

More specifically, a foliage treating agent, a soil treating agent and the like can be exemplified as the plant activator. In addition, this agent may be absorbed prior to planting a plant or a cutting, or added to water at the time of water culture. When the 5-aminolevulinic acid salt is used as a foliage treating agent, it is preferable to contain the 5-aminolevulinic acid salt therein at a concentration of from 1 to 1,000 ppm, particularly from 10 to 500 ppm, and to use this in an amount of from 10 to 100 liters, particularly from 50 to 300 liters, per 10 are.

When the 5-aminolevulinic acid salt is used as a foliage treating agent by applying it prior to plantation, it is preferable to contain the 5-aminolevulinic acid salt at a concentration of from 1 to 1,000 ppm, particularly from 10 to 500 ppm, and to use this in an amount of from 10 to 100 liters, particularly from 50 to 300 liters, per 10 are. In this connection, it is preferable also to use almost the same amount at the time of water culture. As the plant to be treated, cereals, vegetables, fruit trees, flowers and ornamental plants, trees, beans, potatoes, Welsh onions, pasture and the like can be exemplified. Examples The present invention is described below in more detail based on Examples, although the present invention is not limited thereto. Example 1 Production of 5-aminolevulinic acid phosphate: A column was charged with 180 ml of a strongly acidic ion exchange resin (AMBERLITE IR120B Na, manufactured by Japan Organo). The ion exchange resin was used after converting it from sodium ion type to hydrogen ion type through hydrochloric acid treatment. Next, 20.00 g (119 mmol) of 5-aminolevulinic acid hydrochloride was dissolved in 1000 ml of ion exchange water and passed through said column, and then 1000 ml of ion exchange water was passed through the same. Next, 1 N aqueous ammonia was slowly passed through the same to collect 346 ml of yellow eluate. The thus collected eluate was added to 16 ml of 85% phosphoric acid (H 3 PO 4 238 mmol) and concentrated using an evaporator. To the concentrated liquid, 400 ml of acetone was added, followed by vigorously stirring with a stirrer and then allowed to stand at 4\u00b0C for 16 hours. The thus precipitated solid was recovered by suction filtration and washed with 500 ml of acetone.

Example 2 Production of 5-aminolevulinic acid (di-n-butyl phosphate) salt: A column was charged with 180 ml of a strongly acidic ion exchange resin (AMBERLITE IR120B Na, manufactured by Japan Organo). The ion exchange resin was used after converting it from sodium ion type to hydrogen ion type through hydrochloric acid treatment. Next, 20.00 g (119 mmol) of 5-aminolevulinic acid hydrochloride was dissolved in 1000 ml of ion exchange water and passed through said column, and then 1000 ml of ion exchange water was passed through the same. Next, 1 N aqueous ammonia was slowly passed through the same to collect 321 ml of yellow eluate. The thus collected eluate was added to 50.00 g (238 mmol) of di-n-butyl phosphate and concentrated using an evaporator. To the concentrated liquid, 400 ml of acetone was added, followed by vigorously stirring with a stirrer, and then the mixture was allowed to stand at -25\u00b0C for 16 hours. The thus precipitated solid was recovered by suction filtration. The thus obtained solid was dried under reduced pressure for 12 hours to obtain 14.67 g (43 mmol) of the substance of interest.

The results are shown in Table 1. Evaluation criteria: 0: Not smelled. 1: Smelled but not unpleasant. 2: Unpleasant smell. Comparative Example 1 Smells were evaluated in the same manner as in Example 3, except that an aqueous solution of 5-aminolevulinic acid hydrochloride and its solid were used. In this connection, the aqueous solution of 5-aminolevulinic acid hydrochloride was prepared using a solid of 5-aminolevulinic acid hydrochloride, hydrochloric acid and ion exchange water in such a manner that its 5-aminolevulinic acid and chloride ion concentrations respectively became the same molar concentrations of 5-aminolevulinic acid and phosphate ion concentrations of the aqueous solution of 5-aminolevulinic acid phosphate of Example 1.

The results are shown in Table 2. Table 2 Subject A B C D E Example 4 0 0 0 0 0 Comparative Example 2 1 0 1 1 0 Based on Tables 1 and 2, smells were not found in the aqueous solution of 5-aminolevulinic acid phosphate in comparison with the aqueous solution of 5-aminolevulinic acid hydrochloride. Since the anti-odor measure and anti-corrosive gas measure necessary for producing an aqueous solution of 5-aminolevulinic acid hydrochloride were simplified, the handling was more convenient. In addition, the solid of 5-aminolevulinic acid phosphate also generated no smells in comparison with the solid of 5-aminolevulinic acid hydrochloride, so that handlings such as weighing and dispensation were more convenient. Example 5 Acidity measurement of aqueous 5-aminolevulinic acid phosphate solution: Aqueous 5-aminolevulinic acid phosphate solutions and aqueous 5-aminolevulinic acid hydrochloride solutions having a concentration of from 1 to 1000 mM were respectively prepared, and their acidity was measured at 25\u00b0C using a pH meter.

As is apparent from Fig. 1, in the case of the same concentration, acidity of the aqueous 5-aminolevulinic acid phosphate solution was lower than that of the aqueous 5-aminolevulinic acid hydrochloride solution. Example 6 Stimulation test of 5-aminolevulinic acid phosphate: Each of five subjects has evaluated the sense of taste of the 5-aminolevulinic acid phosphate obtained in Example 1, in accordance with the following criteria by directly putting 5 mg of its solid on the tongue. The results are shown in Table 3. Evaluation criteria: 0: No stimulation is felt. 1: There is a stimulation but weak. 2: There is a strong stimulation. Comparative Example 3 The sense of taste was evaluated in the same manner as in Example 6, except that 5 mg of solid of 5-aminolevulinic acid hydrochloride was used. The results are shown in Table 3. Table 3 Example 6 1 1 1 1 1 Comparative Example 3 2 2 2 2 2 As shown in Table 3, strong stimulation was not found in 5-aminolevulinic acid phosphate in comparison with 5-aminolevulinic acid hydrochloride. Example 7 Mutagenicity test (back mutation test) using microorganisms (bacteria): A test was carried out in accordance with the \" Standard of Mutagenicity Tests Using Microorganisms\" (Ministry of Labor Notification No. 77, 1988 ) (partial revision by Ministry of Labor Notification No. 67, 1997 ) and \" Regarding the Tests Concerning Novel Chemical Substances and the like\" (dated November 21, 2003 : Yaku-Shoku-Hatsu No. 1121002, 2003.11.13 Sei-Kyoku, No. 2, Kan-Ho-Ki-Hatsu No. 031121002). To 0.1 ml of a solution prepared by dissolving 5% (w/v) of 5-aminolevulinic acid phosphate in distilled water (Wako Pure Chemical Industries), 0.5 ml of 0.1 M sodium-phosphate buffer (pH 7.4) (0.5 ml S9 mix in the case of metabolism activation test) was added, and 0.1 ml of each test strain suspension (5 strains of histidine-less Salmonella typhimurium TA 100, TA 98, TA 1535 and TA 1537 and tryptophan-less Escherichia coli WP2 uvrA were used (Japan Bioassay Research Center)) was further added thereto, followed by pre-incubation at 37\u00b0C for 20 minutes while shaking. After completion of the culturing, 2.0 ml of top agar kept at 45\u00b0C in advance was added thereto and layered on a minimum glucose agar plate medium. In this case, 2 plates were arranged for each dosage. However, 3 plates were arranged for a solvent control (negative control). After culturing at 37\u00b0C for 48 hours, the presence or absence of growth inhibition of each test strain was observed under a stereoscopic microscope, and the number of appeared back mutation colonies was counted. In the measurement, an inner area of about 80 mm in diameter of a plate of 86 mm in diameter (84 mm in inner diameter) was measured using an automatic colony analyzer (CA-11: manufactured by System Science), and calculated by carrying out area correction and counting loss correction using a personal computer. However, since reliability of the automatic colony analyzer is reduced when the number of colonies is 1,500 or more, 5 points in the plate were manually measured under the stereoscopic microscope to carry out area correction of the average value. A dosage setting test was carried out on 7 dosages diluted at a common ratio of 4, using a dosage of 5,000 \u00b5g/plate as the maximum which is the maximum dosage defined by the guideline. As a result, regardless of the presence or absence of S9 mix, increase of the number of back mutation colonies, by a factor of 2 times or more in comparison with the solvent control, was not found in each strain. Growth inhibition of the strains by this substance to be tested was not found. Precipitation of the substance to be tested was also not found. Thus, this test was carried out by setting 5 dosages diluted at a common ratio of 2, using a dosage of 5,000 \u00b5g/plate as the maximum which is the maximum dosage defined by the guideline. As a result, regardless of the presence or absence of metabolic activity, increase of the number of back mutation colonies, by a factor of 2 times or more in comparison with the solvent control, was not found in each strain (Table 4), so that it was confirmed that the 5-aminolevulinic acid phosphate does not have the mutation inducing ability.

Fasted female rats (Sprague-Dawley CD species) of 3 animals per group were treated with 5-aminolevulinic acid phosphate at a dose of 300 mg per kg body weight. In addition, other fasted female rats of two or more groups were treated at a dose of 2000 mg per kg body weight. They were observed after the administration continuously for 2 weeks. As a result, death was not found in all of the rats (Table 5), there was no sign of systemic toxicity, general body weight gain was found in all rats (Table 6), and it was estimated that the acute oral 50% lethal dose (LD50) was larger than 2,500 mg per kg body weight.

Using three New Zealand white rabbits (males), a solution prepared by dissolving 0.5 g of 5-aminolevulinic acid phosphate in 0.5 ml of distilled water (pH 3.1) was applied for 4 hours to a 2.5 cm square area of the shaved uninjured skin of each animal which was then observed for 1, 24, 48 and 72 hours. As a result, very slight red spots were observed within 24 hours, but became normal when observed after 48 hours (Tables 7 and 8). In addition, when a solution prepared by dissolving 0.5 g of 5-aminolevulinic acid phosphate in 0.5 ml of distilled water (pH 3.1) was applied for 3 minutes or 1 hour to a 2.5 cm square area of the shaved uninjured skin of one New Zealand white rabbit (male), and the animal was observed for 1, 24, 48 and 72 hours, skin stimulation was not observed, too (Tables 7 and 8). Based on this, since the P.I.I value (primary skin irritation index) was 0.5, it was confirmed that this salt is outside the classification of the stimulation classification by the current United Nations recommendation GHS and does not come under a stimulus substance. In this connection, a solution prepared as a control by dissolving 0.5 g of 5-aminolevulinic acid hydrochloride in 0.5 ml of distilled water was judged corrosive by the OECD Guideline because its pH was 2.0 or less, so that the test was not carried out.

Pretreated pig skin total layer (epidermis + dermis) was put on a membrane filter and arranged on the dialysis cell. To its donor layer, 0.5 ml of 1 mM aqueous 5-aminolevulinic acid phosphate solution was added. After 0.2 ml of the solution in the acceptor layer was collected at a predetermined period of time, the layer was supplemented with new physiological saline. Then, 0.05 ml of the collected sample or standard liquid was mixed with 3.5 ml of a liquid A (1 liter of a mixed solution of acetyl acetone/ethanol/water = 15/10/75 (v/v/v) containing 4 g of sodium chloride) and 0.45 ml of a liquid B (a solution prepared by diluting 85 ml of formalin to 1 liter with water), and the mixture was heating-treated for 30 minutes and then, after 30 minutes, cooled with water. Thereafter, concentration of 5-aminolevulinic acid was measured by HPLC (this was carried out under analyzing conditions of 1.0 ml/min flow rate and 25\u00b0C temperature, using a fluorescence detector of 473 nm in excitation wavelength and 363 nm in fluorescence wavelength, using an aqueous methanol/2.5% acetic acid solution = 40/60 (v/v) solution as the eluting solution, and using Wakosil-II 5C18HG, 4.6 m\u03c6 \u00d7 150 mm, as the column), and each concentration was calculated from the peak area of the standard liquid. Next, the same test was carried out using onion epidermis instead of the pig skin and by changing concentration of the aqueous 5-aminolevulinic acid phosphate solution to 0.1 mM. The results are shown in Figs. 3 and 4. As can be understood from Figs. 3 and 4, 5-aminolevulinic acid hydrochloride and 5-aminolevulinic acid phosphate showed similar permeability in the pig skin and onion epidermis. Comparative Example 4 Permeability was measured in the same manner as in Example 10, except that 5-aminolevulinic acid hydrochloride was used instead of 5-aminolevulinic acid phosphate. It was confirmed by this that, although 5-aminolevulinic acid hydrochloride causes a stimulation when directly applied to the skin as shown in Example 9, 5-aminolevulinic acid phosphate does not cause the skin stimulation, and they have the same permeability into the skin, thus showing that 5-aminolevulinic acid phosphate is a salt more useful than 5-aminolevulinic acid hydrochloride in certain medical treatments (photodynamic treatment and photodynamic diagnosis) and plants. Example 11 Test on the generation of silver chloride precipitation: In 10 ml of ion exchange water, 0.5 g of 5-aminolevulinic acid phosphate and 0.5 g of silver nitrate were dissolved, the mixture was allowed to stand still for 5 minutes, and conditions of the liquid was observed. Generation of the precipitate was not found. In this connection, 0.5 g of 5-aminolevulinic acid hydrochloride and 0.5 g of silver nitrate were dissolved in 10 ml of ion exchange water and allowed to stand still for 5 minutes, and conditions of the liquid was observed. Generation of the precipitate was found. Example 12 Coloring test of apple: The 5-aminolevulinic acid phosphate obtained in Example 1 was dissolved in ion exchange water to the predetermined concentration shown in the following table. A spreader (\"Approach BI\" manufactured by Maruwa Biochemical) was added to the liquid to a concentration of 0.1% by weight. The pH was adjusted using phosphoric acid. An aqueous 5-aminolevulinic acid hydrochloride solution was prepared in the same manner, except that the above-described 5-aminolevulinic acid phosphate was changed to 5-aminolevulinic acid hydrochloride and the phosphoric acid for pH adjustment was changed to hydrochloric acid. The thus prepared liquid was sprayed at a ratio of 2 liters per branch on three main branches where young fruits of an apple variety \"Fuji\" bored but not yet colored into red (September 15). About 2 months thereafter (November 6), the apples were harvested and their coloring degree was examined. A color meter CR-200 manufactured by MINOLTA CAMERA was used for the measurement of color. The results are shown in Table 9.

In the Lab values in Table 9, L represents brightness, a represents red and b represents yellow. Accordingly, higher value of a means denser red. Coloring of red was denser in the case of 5-aminolevulinic acid phosphate than the case of 5-aminolevulinic acid hydrochloride. Example 13 Plant activating effect: A total of 12 pots, in which 600 g of volcanic ash soil was packed in a porcelain pot of 12 cm in inner diameter, and 1 plant of a spiderwort Commelina communis grown to a height of 15 cm was planted in 1 pot, were prepared and placed under a constant temperature environment of 20\u00b0C, and foliar application treatment was carried out once a day using the following application liquids. Conditions of the leaves 21 days thereafter were observed. The results are summarized in Table 10.

Example 14 Plant growth regulation effect: Rice seeds ( Akinishiki ) were soaked in Benlate (manufactured by Sumika Takeda Engei) (200 times) aqueous solution for a whole day and night and then incubated at 30\u00b0C under a dark condition to effect hastening of germination. Seeds of even pigeon breast stage were selected, 10 seeds were inserted using a pair of tweezers into a groove on one expanded polyethylene sheet, which was made using a cutter knife, and this sheet was floated on a tall Petri dish filled with 150 ml of 5-aminolevulinic acid phosphate of respective concentrations shown in Table 11 and incubated at 25\u00b0C for 24 hours under 5,000 lux continuous light irradiation. The number of repetitions was set to 3 repetitions for each concentration. Examination was carried out three days thereafter, and lengths of the first leaf sheath and seminal root in each plot were measured to calculate their ratios to those in the untreated plot and to calculate average values thereof. The results are shown in Table 11.

Example 15 Salinity tolerance improving effect: A porcelain pot of 12 cm in inner diameter having no drainage hole was filled with 600 g of upland soil, and 7 to 8 seeds of cotton seeds (variety; M-5 Acala) were sowed, covered with 1 cm in thickness of the soil and allowed to grow in a green house. Thereafter, general management was carried out, and at the time of leaflet development, a salinity improving agent containing each of the compounds to be tested with respective concentrations shown in Table 12 and 0.05% (v/v) of a spreader (Neoesterin: manufactured by Kumiai Chemical Industry) was prepared and was applied to foliage at an application volume of 100 liters per 10 are. Each of the compounds to be tested was set to the concentration shown in Table 12. Four days thereafter, sodium chloride in an amount which corresponds to 0 to 1.5% by weight per soil weight as shown in Table 12 was dissolved in 30 ml of water and added dropwise to the soil. By further continuing general cultivation, examination was carried out 23 days thereafter. the examination was carried out by naked eye observation, and the results of salt damage were evaluated based on the following 6 steps. The results are shown in Table 12. Evaluation steps: 0: Absolutely no salt damage is observed. 1: Very weak salt damage is observed. 2: Weak salt damage is observed. 3: Obvious salt damage is observed. 4: Strong salt damage is observed. 5: The plant body withered up due to salt damage.

When chloride ion concentration in the aqueous 5-aminolevulinic acid phosphate solutions used in the above-described examples was measured by ion chromatography under the following conditions, it was equal to or lower than the detection limit (0.1 ppm) in each sample. The measuring conditions are as follows; A: separation column (IonPac AS12A manufactured by Japan Dionex), B: guard column (IonPac AG12A manufactured by Japan Dionex), C: eluting solution (an aqueous solution containing Na 2 CO 3 : 3.0 mmol/l and NaHCO 3 : 0.5 mmol/l), D: flow rate (1.5 ml/min), E: suppressor (ASRS (recycle mode, current value 50 mA)), F: amount of introduced sample (25 \u00b5l), G: temperature of constant temperature oven (35\u00b0C) and H: detector (electric conductivity detector). Example 16 Production of 5-aminolevulinic acid nitrate: A column was charged with 180 ml of a strongly acidic ion exchange resin (AMBERLITE IR120B Na, manufactured by Japan Organo). The ion exchange resin was used after converting it from sodium ion type to hydrogen ion type through a hydrochloric acid treatment. Next, 36.00 g (214 mmol) of 5-aminolevulinic acid hydrochloride was dissolved in 1800 ml of ion exchange water and passed through said column, and then 1000 ml of ion exchange water was passed through the same. Next, 1 N aqueous ammonia was slowly passed through the same to collect 594 ml of yellow eluate. The thus collected eluate was added to 33 ml of 60% nitric acid (HNO 3 442 mmol) and concentrated using an evaporator. To the concentrated liquid, 400 ml of methyl acetate was added, followed by vigorously stirring with a stirrer and then the mixture was allowed to stand at 4\u00b0C for 16 hours. The thus precipitated solid was recovered by suction filtration and washed with 500 ml of methyl acetate. The thus obtained solid was dried under reduced pressure for 12 hours to obtain 31.09 g (160 mmol) of the substance of interest. Its physical property data are shown below.

Example 17 Odor measurement of 5-aminolevulinic acid nitrate: Five subjects have directly smelled an aqueous solution of the 5-aminolevulinic acid nitrate produced in Example 16 (a mixed liquid of the eluate from the column and nitric acid) and its solid, and evaluated their smells in the same manner as in Example 3. The results are shown in Table 13. Comparative Example 5 Smells were evaluated in the same manner as in Example 17, except that an aqueous solution of 5-aminolevulinic acid hydrochloride and its solid were used. In this connection, the aqueous solution of 5-aminolevulinic acid hydrochloride was prepared using a solid of 5-aminolevulinic acid hydrochloride, hydrochloric acid and ion exchange water in such a manner that its 5-aminolevulinic acid and chloride ion concentrations respectively became the same molar concentrations of 5-aminolevulinic acid and nitrate ion concentrations of the aqueous solution of 5-aminolevulinic acid nitrate of Example 16.

Table 14 Subjects A B C D E Example 18 0 0 0 0 0 Comparative Example 6 1 0 1 1 0 Based on Tables 13 and 14, smells were not found in the aqueous solution of 5-aminolevulinic acid nitrate in comparison with the aqueous solution of 5-aminolevulinic acid hydrochloride. Since the anti-odor measure and anti-corrosive gas measure necessary for producing an aqueous solution of 5-aminolevulinic acid hydrochloride were not necessary, the handling was more convenient. In addition, the solid of 5-aminolevulinic acid nitrate also generated no smells in comparison with the solid of 5-aminolevulinic acid hydrochloride, so that handlings such as weighing and dispensation were more convenient. Example 19 Test on the generation of silver chloride precipitate: In 10 ml of ion exchange water, 0.5 g of 5-aminolevulinic acid nitrate and 0.5 g of silver nitrate were dissolved, the mixture was allowed to stand still for 5 minutes, and conditions of the liquid was observed. Generation of the precipitate was not found. In this connection, 0.5 g of 5-aminolevulinic acid hydrochloride and 0.5 g of silver nitrate were dissolved in 10 ml of ion exchange water and allowed to stand still for 5 minutes, and conditions of the liquid was observed. Generation of the precipitate was found. Example 20 Plant activating effect: After 600 g of upland soil was packed in a porcelain pot of 12 cm in inner diameter, 12 grains of radish seeds were sowed therein, covered with 5 mm in depth of the soil and allowed to grow in a green house. Foliar application treatment was carried out once a day using the following application liquids. Conditions of the leaves 21 days thereafter were observed. The results are summarized in Table 15.

Example 21 Coloring test of apple: The 5-aminolevulinic acid nitrate obtained in Example 16 was dissolved in ion exchange water to the predetermined concentration shown in Table 16. A spreader (\"Approach BI\" manufactured by Maruwa Biochemical) was added to the liquid to a concentration of 0.1% by weight. The pH was adjusted using nitric acid. A solution was prepared in the same manner, except that the above-described 5-aminolevulinic acid nitrate was changed to 5-aminolevulinic acid hydrochloride and the nitric acid was changed to hydrochloric acid. The thus prepared liquid was sprayed at a ratio of 2 liters per branch on three main branches where young fruits of an apple variety \"Fuji\" bored but not yet colored into red (September 15). About 2 months thereafter (November 6), the apples were harvested and their coloring degree was examined. A color meter CR-200 manufactured by MINOLTA CAMERA was used for the measurement of color.

Example 22 Culturing of plankton: 5-Aminolevulinic acid nitrate was added, to a concentration of 1 mM (194 ppm), to 100 ml of a sterilized culture shown in Table 17 (components of the culture), and a Chlorella sp. was inoculated therein and cultured on a reciprocal shaker at 30\u00b0C under aerobic and dark conditions to measure the amount of cells (OD 660). 5-Aminolevulinic acid hydrochloride was added, to a concentration of 1 mM (168 ppm), to 100 ml of the sterilized culture shown in Table 17 (components of the culture), and the Chlorella sp. was inoculated therein and cultured on a reciprocal shaker at 30\u00b0C under aerobic and dark conditions to measure the amount of cells (OD 660). The Chlorella sp. was inoculated into 100 ml of the sterilized culture shown in Table 17 (components of the culture) and cultured on a reciprocal shaker at 30\u00b0C under aerobic and dark conditions to measure the amount of cells (OD 660).

When chloride ion concentration in the aqueous 5-aminolevulinic acid nitrate solutions used in the above-described examples was measured by ion chromatography under the following conditions, it was equal to or lower than the detection limit (0.1 ppm) in each sample. The measuring conditions are as follows: A: separation column (IonPac AS12A manufactured by Japan Dionex), B: guard column (IonPac AG12A manufactured by Japan Dionex), C: eluting solution (an aqueous solution consisting of Na 2 CO 3 : 3.0 mmol/l and NaHCO 3 : 0.5 mmol/l), D: flow rate (1.5 ml/min), E: suppressor (ASRS (recycle mode, current value 50 mA)), F: amount of introduced sample (25 \u00b5l), G: temperature of constant temperature oven (35\u00b0C) and H: detector (electric conductivity detector). Example 23 Production of 5-aminolevulinic acid p -toluenesulfonate: A column was charged with 180 ml of a strongly acidic ion exchange resin (AMBERLITE IR120B Na, manufactured by Japan Organo). The ion exchange resin was used after converting it from sodium ion type to hydrogen ion type through a hydrochloric acid treatment. Next, 36.00 g (215 mmol) of 5-aminolevulinic acid hydrochloride was dissolved in 1800 ml of ion exchange water and passed through said column, and then 1000 ml of ion exchange water was passed through the same. Next, 1 N aqueous ammonia was slowly passed through the same to collect 555 ml of yellow eluate. The thus collected eluate was mixed with 81.72 g (430 mmol) of p -toluenesulfonic acid monohydrate and concentrated using an evaporator. To the concentrated liquid, 400 ml of acetone was added, followed by vigorously stirring with a stirrer and then the mixture was allowed to stand still at 4\u00b0C for 16 hours. The thus precipitated solid was recovered by suction filtration and washed with 400 ml of acetone. The thus obtained solid was dried under reduced pressure for 12 hours to obtain 47.78 g (158 mmol) of the substance of interest. Its physical property data are shown below.

The results are shown in Table 19. Comparative Example 7 Smells were evaluated in the same manner as in Example 24, except that an aqueous solution of 5-aminolevulinic acid hydrochloride and its solid were used. In this connection, the aqueous solution of 5-aminolevulinic acid hydrochloride was prepared using a solid of 5-aminolevulinic acid hydrochloride, hydrochloric acid and ion exchange water in such a manner that its 5-aminolevulinic acid and chloride ion concentrations respectively became the same molar concentrations of 5-aminolevulinic acid and p -toluenesulfonate ion concentrations of the aqueous solution of 5-aminolevulinic acid p -toluenesulfonate of Example 23. The results are shown in Table 19.

The results are shown in Table 20. (Comparative Example 8) Smells were evaluated in the same manner as in Example 24, except that an aqueous solution prepared by dissolving 0.5 g of 5-aminolevulinic acid hydrochloride in 1 ml of water was used. The results are shown in Table 20. Table 20 Subjects A B C D E Example 25 0 0 0 0 0 Comparative Example 8 1 0 1 1 0 Based on Tables 19 and 20, smells were not found in the aqueous solution of 5-aminolevulinic acid p -toluenesulfonate in comparison with the aqueous solution of 5-aminolevulinic acid hydrochloride. Since the anti-odor measure and anti-corrosive gas measure necessary for producing aqueous solution of 5-aminolevulinic acid hydrochloride were not necessary, the handling was more convenient. In addition, the solid of 5-aminolevulinic acid p -toluenesulfonate also generated no smells in comparison with the solid of 5-aminolevulinic acid hydrochloride, so that handlings such as weighing and dispensation were more convenient. (Example 26) Heat resistance under crystalline state: Melting points were measured using a melting point apparatus. Table 21 Melting point (\u00b0C) 5-Aminolevulinic acid p -toluenesulfonate 186 5-Aminolevulinic acid hydrochloride 156 As shown in Table 21, holding of the solid state was superior in 5-aminolevulinic acid p -toluenesulfonate than 5-aminolevulinic acid hydrochloride. Example 27 Degradation test by sterilization: Firstly, 50 mg of 5-aminolevulinic acid p -toluenesulfonate or 5-aminolevulinic acid hydrochloride was heat sterilized (121\u00b0C, 20 minutes, 1.5 kgf/cm 2 ). After confirming that there is no change in weight before and after the sterilization, degree of degradation of 5-aminolevulinic acid before and after the sterilization was verified by the method described in a reference ( Clin. Chem., 36/8, 1494 (1990 )). The results are shown in Table 22 Table 22 Degradation degree (%) 5-Aminolevulinic acid p -toluenesulfonate 2.7 5-Aminolevulinic acid hydrochloride 6.6 As shown in Table 22, it was found that 5-aminolevulinic acid p -toluenesulfonate has lower degradability by high temperature heat sterilization treatment than the case of 5-aminolevulinic acid hydrochloride. Example 28 Test on the generation of silver chloride precipitate: In 10 ml of ion exchange water, 0.5 g of 5-aminolevulinic acid p -toluenesulfonate and 0.5 g of silver nitrate were dissolved, the mixture was allowed to stand still for 5 minutes, and conditions of the liquid was observed. Generation of the precipitate was not found. In this connection, 0.5 g of 5-aminolevulinic acid hydrochloride and 0.5 g of silver nitrate were dissolved in 10 ml of ion exchange water and allowed to stand still for 5 minutes, and conditions of the liquid was observed. Generation of the precipitate was found. Example 29 Plant activating effect: After 600 g of upland soil was packed in a porcelain pot of 12 cm in inner diameter, 12 grains of radish seeds were sowed therein, covered with 5 mm in depth of the soil and allowed to grow in a green house. Foliar application treatment was carried out once a day using the following application liquids. Conditions of the leaves 21 days thereafter were observed. The results are summarized in Table 23. The judging criteria are the same as of Example 13.

Example 30 Coloring test of apple: The 5-aminolevulinic acid p -toluenesulfonate obtained in Example 23 was dissolved in ion exchange water to the predetermined concentration shown in Table 24. A spreader (\"Approach B1\" manufactured by Maruwa Biochemical) was added to the liquid to a concentration of 0.1% by weight. The pH was adjusted using p -toluenesulfonic acid. A solution was prepared in the same manner, except that the above-described 5-aminolevulinic acid p -toluenesulfonate was changed to 5-aminolevulinic acid hydrochloride and the p -toluenesulfonic acid was changed to hydrochloric acid. The thus prepared liquid was sprayed at a ratio of 2 liters per branch on three main branches where young fruits of an apple variety \"Fuji\" bored but not yet colored into red (September 15). About 2 months thereafter (November 6), the apples were harvested and their coloring degree was examined. A color meter CR-200 manufactured by MINOLTA CAMERA was used for the measurement of color. The results are shown in Table 24.

In the Lab values in Table 24, L represents brightness, a represents red and b represents yellow. Accordingly, higher value of a means denser red. Coloring of red was denser in the case of 5-aminolevulinic acid p -toluenesulfonate than the case of 5-aminolevulinic acid hydrochloride. When chloride ion concentration in the aqueous 5-aminolevulinic acid p -toluenesulfonate solutions used in the above-described examples was measured by ion chromatography under the following conditions, it was equal to or lower than the detection limit (0.1 ppm) in each sample. The measuring conditions are as follows: A: separation column (IonPac AS12A manufactured by Japan Dionex), B: guard column (IonPac AG12A manufactured by Japan Dionex), C: eluting solution (an aqueous solution consisting of Na 2 CO 3 : 3.0 mmol/l and NaHCO 3 : 0.5 mmol/l), D: flow rate (1.5 ml/min), E: suppressor (ASRS (recycle mode, current value 50 mA)), F: amount of introduced sample (25 \u00b5l), G: temperature of constant temperature oven (35\u00b0C) and H: detector (electric conductivity detector).
