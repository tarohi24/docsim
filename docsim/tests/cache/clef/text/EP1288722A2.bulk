{"docid": "EP0762208B1", "title": "Light sensitive composition", "text": "FIELD OF THE INVENTION The present invention relates to a photopolymerizable light-sensitive composition, a presensitized lithographic printing plate having therein a light-sensitive layer composed of the light-sensitive composition, and further to an image forming method employing the presensitized lithographic printing plate. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION A photopolymerizable composition has been used commonly as an image forming layer of a negative working presensitized lithographic printing plate. When applying the photopolymerizable composition to a presensitized lithographic printing plate, adhesiveness between an image forming layer  composed of a photopolymerizable composition and an aluminum support is important and printing durability related to the adhesiveness characteristics is also important. However, compared with a presensitized lithographic printing plate having a diazonium salt light-sensitive layer used for an image forming layer of a negative working presensitized lithographic printing plate which is commonly put to practical use, a layer of a photopolymerizable composition is extremely poor in terms of adhesiveness, which is a weak point. As a technology for overcoming the weak point mentioned above, an aluminum support on which a phosphoric acid anodizing film is formed is disclosed in Japanese Patent Examined Publication No. 46-26521/1971 and an aluminum support treated by polyvinyl phosphonic acid is disclosed in Japanese Patent Examined Publication No. 46-35685/1971. However, layer removal on a non-image area is insufficient and it causes stain on a print, though the adhesiveness is improved for aforesaid both cases. As another technology for overcoming the aforesaid weak point, addition of diazonium salt to a layer of a photopolymerizable composition and a subbing layer containing a diazonium salt are disclosed in Japanese Patent Examined Publication No. 50-7481/1975. However, these methods are not only impossible to be used for direct plate making  wherein a laser beam or the like is used because diazonium salt can not be subjected to spectral sensitization, but also are undesirable from the environmental viewpoint. Though there is disclosed a photopolymerizable composition employing a benzophenone group-containing organic peroxide and organic dyes in Japanese Patent O.P.I. Publication No. 60-76503/1985, it has a problem that its adhesiveness to a support is insufficient, though its sensitivity is high. Though there is disclosed a photopolymerizable composition containing both acrylic binder containing 2 - 50 mol% of a glycidyl acrylate unit and polymerizable compound in Japanese Patent O.P.I. Publication No. 61-148444/1986, it has a problem that an image defect is caused because it is easily affected by oxygen and thereby is deteriorated in terms of its efficiency, and an unexposed portion sticks to a grained support not to be dissolved in a developing solution. In Japanese Patent O.P.I. Publication No. 2-84651/1990, there is disclosed an invention to offer a light-sensitive composition which has high sensitivity and is excellent in storage stability and temperature dependency by employing a photopolymerizable light-sensitive composition having a polymer binder that includes an acrylic structure unit having an acryl group on an end of the side chain. However, there has  been a problem of sensitivity drop caused by radical production in course of time and of stain occurrence on non-image portions. Further, Japanese Patent O.P.I. Publication No. 2-289857/1990 discloses a technology for improving the adhesiveness to a base plate by introducing a unit having a reactive group in a copolymer having a carboxyl group. However, there has been a problem of sensitivity drop caused by radical production in course of time and of stain occurrence on non-image portions. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION The object of the invention is to provide a photopolymerizable light-sensitive composition as claimed in claim 1 which, when applied to a presensitized lithographic printing plate, is excellent in sensitivity and printing durability, and makes it possible to obtain a print with high quality and without stain on a non-image area which produces in course of time, and is free from sensitivity drop caused during a period of its storage and further is capable of being written thereon with a laser beam.

Treatment conditions for the mechanical roughening method or the electro-chemical roughening method are selected so that the finished surface state of an aluminum plate may be the same as that of the invention. The selection of the conditions can be made through a simple experiment. After the roughening treatment, there is conducted anodizing treatment.  There is no limitation, in particular, for an anodizing method usable in the invention, and known methods can be used. Anodizing treatment forms an oxide film on a support. In the invention, anodizing treatment employs preferably a method of electrolyzing with current density of 1 - 10 A/dm 2  in an electrolyte of an aqueous solution containing a sulfuric acid and/or a phosphoric acid at 10 - 50% density. In addition to that, a method of electrolyzing at high current density in a sulfuric acid described in U.S. Patent No. 1,412,768 and a method of electrolyzing by the use of a phosphoric acid described in U.S. Patent No. 3,511,661 can be used. A support subjected to anodizing treatment can further be subjected to sealing of anodic oxide coating, in case of need. Known methods such as hot water treatment, boiled water treatment, steam treatment, sodium silicate treatment, dichromate aqueous solution treatment, nitrite treatment and ammonium acetate treatment can be used for the sealing of anodic oxide coating. It is preferable that the support is further provided with a hydrophilic layer. For forming the hydrophilic layer, it is possible to use alkali metal silicate described in U.S. Patent No. 3,181,461, hydrophilic cellulose described in U.S. Patent No.1,860,426, an amino acid and its salt described in Japanese Patent O.P.I. Publication Nos. 149491/1985 and  165183/1988, amines and their salts described in Japanese Patent O.P.I. Publication No.165183/1988, phosphate described in Japanese Patent O.P.I. Publication No. 19494/1987 and high polymer compounds including monomer unit having a sulfo group described in Japanese Patent O.P.I.

Further, for preventing that scratches are caused on a light-sensitive layer when presensitized lithographic printing plates are stacked, and for preventing that aluminum components liquate out in a developing solution in the course of development, it is possible to conduct processing for providing a protective layer on the back side of a support described in Japanese Patent O.P.I. Publication Nos. 151136/1975, 63293/1982, 73538/1985, 67863/1986 and 35174/1994. The presensitized lithographic printing plate of the invention may be provided with a protective layer containing water-soluble resins which are dissolved at 1% or more in water of 25\u00b0C. The water-soluble resin that can be used includes, for example, polymers excellent in oxygen-interception such as polyvinyl alcohol, polyvinylacetal, maltotriose and acid cellulose. It is preferable that a compound containing fluorine such as, for example, a fluorine  type surfactant, a nonionic surfactant, an anionic surfactant, or a cationic surfactant is added to the protective layer. In a method for obtaining a presensitized lithographic printing plate of the invention, an aluminum plate is subjected to roughening treatment and anodizing treatment so that the surface of the aluminum plate may be finished to be the specific state mentioned above, and a coating solution wherein aforesaid light-sensitive composition is dissolved in a solvent is coated on the surface of the aluminum plate so that a layer containing a light-sensitive composition may be provided thereon. The solvent for dissolving the light sensitive composition includes methylcellosolve, methylcellosolve acetate, ethylcellosolve, ethylcellosolve acetate, diethylene glycol monomethylether, diethylene glycol monoethylether, diethylene glycol dimethylether, diethylene glycol methylethylether, diethylene glycol diethylether, diethylene glycol monoisopropylether, propylene glycol, propylene glycol monoethylether acetate, propylene glycol monobutylether, dipropylene glycol monomethylether, dipropylene glycol dimethylether, dipropylene glycol methylethylether, ethyl formate, propyl formate, butyl formate, amyl formate, methyl acetate, ethyl acetate, propyl acetate, butyl acetate, methyl propionate, ethyl propionate, methyl butyrate, ethyl butyrate,  dimethylformamide, dimethylsulfoxide, dioxane, acetone, methylethylketone, cyclopentanone, cyclohexanone, methylcyclohexanone, diacetonealcohol, acetylacetone, \u03b3-butyrolactone. These solvents can be used singly or in combination. The coating method for coating the light sensitive composition on a support includes a conventional coating method such as whirl coating, dip coating, air-knife coating, spray coating, air-spray coating, static air-spray coating, roll coating, blade coating or curtain coating. The coating amount is preferably 0.05 to 5.0 g/m 2  as a solid, although the amount varies depending on the usage. When processing a presensitized lithographic printing plate in the invention, conventional and ordinary methods are used. Namely, a presensitized lithographic printing plate is exposed through a transparent original image having therein a line image and a screen image, and then is developed by a water developing solution, thereby, it is possible to obtain a negative relief image for the original image. A light source of active light suitable for the exposure includes a carbon arc lamp, a mercury lamp, a xenon lamp, a metal halide lamp, a strobe, and a laser beam. A light-sensitive composition in the invention is sufficiently sensitive to a visible laser beam  such as argon ion laser, and is preferably used for scanning exposure conducted by the visible laser beam such as argon ion laser based on digitized information. When using an array-type light source such as a light-emitting diode array, or when exposure-controlling a light source such as a halogen lamp, a metal halide lamp and a tungsten lamp with an optical shutter material such as a liquid crystal or PLZT, digital exposure according to an image signal can be performed. In this case, it is possible to write in directly without using a mask blank. In the case of a laser beam, it is suitable for writing in directly without using a mask blank, because it is possible to collimate the rays into a beam and thereby to conduct scanning exposure in accordance with image data. When laser is used as a light source, it is easy to narrow down an exposure area to be in a minimum size and thereby it is possible to form an image with high resolution. Laser sources used in the invention include, provided that the laser source has its oscillation wavelength in a visible light zone, well-known solid state laser such as YAG laser and its second harmonic, gas laser such as He-Ne laser, CO 2  laser, Ar ion laser, Kr ion laser and He-Cd laser, and other discharged and excited molecule laser, excimer laser, chemical laser, dye laser and semiconductor laser. Among them,  the second harmonic of YAG laser, He-Ne laser, semiconductor laser and Ar ion laser are preferable. Among semiconductor lasers, it is preferable to use the so-called single mode laser diode as one wherein a 1/e 2  diameter is easily narrowed down to several \u00b5m - several tens \u00b5m at a focal point without lowering optical efficiency greatly. A light source other than laser includes a light-emitting diode (LED). The LED and semiconductor laser are easily used as an array wherein a plurality of light-emitting elements are integrated. When a wavelength of 400 - 550 nm is required as that of a light source, it is also possible to convert to a half-wave length by combining semiconductor later and an element having nonlinear optics effect or combining YAG laser and an element having nonlinear optics effect. A scanning method by means of a laser beam includes a method of scanning on an outer surface of a cylinder, a method of scanning on an inner surface of a cylinder and a method of scanning on a plane. In the method of scanning on an outer surface of a cylinder, laser beam exposure is conducted while a drum around which a recording material is wound is rotated, in which main scanning is represented by the rotation of the drum, while sub-scanning is represented by the movement of the  laser beam. In the method of scanning on an inner surface of a cylinder, a recording material is fixed on the inner surface of a drum, a laser beam is emitted from the inside, and main scanning is carried out in the circumferential direction by rotating a part of or an entire part of an optical system, while sub-scanning is carried out in the axial direction by moving straight a part of or an entire part of the optical system in parallel with a shaft of the drum. In the method of scanning on a plane, main scanning by means of a laser beam is carried out through a combination of a polygon mirror, a galvano mirror and an F \ue70d lens, and sub-scanning is carried out by moving a recording medium. The method of scanning on an outer surface of a cylinder and the method of scanning on an inner surface of a cylinder are more suitable for high density recording because they make it easy to enhance a precision of an optical system. In the case of the method of scanning on an outer surface of a cylinder, it is easy to enhance a scanning speed by raising the speed of rotation of a drum, but enhancement of the speed of rotation tends to cause charging on a recording material, resulting in attraction of dust which creates an image defect. In the case of the so-called multi-channel exposure wherein a plurality of light-emitting elements are used  simultaneously, the method of scanning on an outer surface of a cylinder is optimum. The developer for developing a presensitized lithographic printing plate using the light sensitive composition of the invention may be any conventional developer, and is preferably a solution containing a specific organic solvent, an alkali agent and water as essential components. The specific solvent herein referred to is a solvent having a solubility in 20\u00b0C water of 10 weight % or less which is capable of dissolving or swelling non-image portions of the light sensitive layer in the developer containing the solvent. Such a solvent may be any solvent, if the solvent has the above characteristics, and the examples thereof includes carboxylates such as ethyl acetate, propyl acetate, butyl acetate, amyl acetate, benzyl acetate, ethylene glycol monobutylacetate, butyl lactate and butyl levulinate, ketones such as ethylbutyl ketone, methylisobutyl ketone and cyclohexanone, alcohols such as ethylene glycol monobutylether, ethylene glycol benzylether, ethylene glycol monophenylether, benzyl alcohol, methylphenyl carbinol, n-amyl alcohol and methyl amyl alcohol, an alkyl-substituted aromatic hydrocarbon such as xylene and halogenated hydrocarbons such as methylene dichloride, ethylene dichloride and monochlorobenzene. As solvent may be used one kind or more. Among these solvents,  ethylene glycol monophenylether or benzyl alcohol is especially preferable. The solvent content of the developer is ordinarily 0.001 to 20 weight %, and preferably 0.01 to 10 weight %. The alkali agent contained in the developer includes sodium silicate, potassium silicate, sodium hydroxide, potassium hydroxide, lithium hydroxide, a di or trisodium phosphate, a di or triammonium phosphate, sodium metasilicate, sodium carbonate, potassium carbonate, ammonia, monomethylamine, dimethylamine, trimethylamine, monoethylamine, diethylamine, triethylamine, monoisopropylamine, diisopropylamine, n-butylamine, monoethanolamine, diethanolamine, triethanolamine, monoisopropanolamine, diisopropanolamine, triisopropanolamine, ethyleneamine and ethylenediamine. The preferable are potassium silicate, sodium silicate, disodium phosphate, sodium carbonate, sodium bicarbonate, potassium carbonate, monoethanolamine, diethanolamine and triethanolamine. The alkali agent may be used singly or in combination. The ordinary content of these alkaline agents in a developing solution is 0.05 - 8 wt% and preferable content is 0.5 - 6 wt%.  For further enhancement of storage stability and printing durability, it is preferable to make water-soluble sulfite to be contained in a developing solution as occasion demands. As a sulfite of such type, an alkali metal sulfite or an alkali earth metal sulfite is preferable, and there are given, for example, sodium sulfite, potassium sulfite, lithium sulfite and magnesium sulfite. Ordinary content of these sulfites in a developing solution in terms of its composition is 0.05 - 4 wt%, and preferable content is 0.1 - 1 wt%. For accelerating dissolution of aforesaid specific organic solvent in water, it is also possible to cause a certain solubilizing agent to be contained. As the solubilizing agent mentioned above, it is preferable to use low molecular alcohol and ketones which are soluble in water more easily than the specific organic solvent to be used. It is also possible to use anionic surfactants and ampholytic surfactants. As alcohol and ketones mentioned above, it is preferable to use methanol, ethanol, propanol, butanol, acetone, methylethyl ketone, ethyleneglycol monomethyl ether, ethyleneglycol monoethyl ether, methoxybutanol, ethoxybutanol, 4-methoxymethylbutanol and N-methylpyrrolidone, for example. Further, as a surfactant, isopropyl naphthalene sodium solfonate, n-butyl naphthalene sodium sulfonate, N-methyl-N-pentadecylamino sodium acetate and lauryl sodium sulfate are  preferable. Though there is no limitation for an amount of the solubilizing agent such as alcohol and ketones to be used, the amount of about 30 wt% or less for the total of a developing solution is generally preferable. In the case of a presensitized lithographic printing plate, when it is brought into contact with the developing solution mentioned above, or it is rubbed further after it is subjected imagewise exposure, light-sensitive composition on a non-image portion can be removed thoroughly in 10 - 60 seconds at about 10 - 40\u00b0C, without affecting adversely an exposed portion on a light-sensitive layer.

Thus, vinyl type polymer 4 in the invention was obtained. Mw according to GPC was 30,000. Example 1 On 0.24-mm-thick aluminum support 1 subjected to electrolytic roughening treatment employing hydrochloric acid, and then to treatment for making the aluminum support to be hydrophilic with sodium silicate, there was coated light-sensitive solution 1 shown below by the use of a wire bar to obtain a thickness of dried coating of 2.0 \u00b5m, and they were dried for 2 minutes at 80\u00b0C under the condition of light-shielding so that a light-sensitive layer was formed.  Light-sensitive solution 1 Vinyl type polymer 1 (binder 1) (MMA/EA/MAA/unit of Formula (1) = 70/20/9/1 (by weight) Mw : 30000) 35.0 parts by weight  3,3'-carbonylbis (diethylamino cumarine) 5.0 parts by weight 3,3',4,4'-tetrakis (t-butyldioxycarbonyl) benzophenone 3.0 parts by weight DPHA/U324A (produced by Nakamura Co. Ltd.) 50.0 parts by weight Phthalocyanine pigment (MHI454:made by Mikuni Shikiso) 1.0 part by weight 2-tert-butyl-6-(3-tert-butyl-2-hydroxy-5-methylbenzyl)-4-methylphenylacrylate 0.5 parts by weight Fluorine-containing surfactant (FC-431 produced by Sumitomo-3M Co. Ltd.) 1.0 part by weight Cyclopentanon/MEK(1/1) was added to obtain a 8% by weight solution. Further, an over-coat layer coating solution having the following composition was coated by means of an applicator on aforesaid light-sensitive layer in a way to get a thickness of dried coating of 2.0 \u00b5m, and then, was dried for 3 minutes at 80\u00b0C under the condition of light-shielding. Thus, presensitized lithographic printing plate 1 was obtained.  Over-coat layer coating solution Polyvinyl alcohol (GL-05 made by Nihon Gosei Kagaku Co.) 99 parts by weight  Surfactant (F-12: made by Dainihon Ink Co. Ltd.) 1 part by weight Water 900 parts by weight The presensitized lithographic printing plate 1 thus prepared was subjected to exposure conducted by a daylight room printer (P-627-HA made by Dainihon Screen Co.), then was dipped in SDN-21(made by Konica Corp.) at 30\u00b0C for 30 seconds so that a light-sensitive layer on an unexposed portion may be dissolved out, and it was washed with water and dried so that an image thus formed was evaluated. In evaluation of printing durability, an image of Ugra plate control wedge PCW82 (made by Mika Denshi Co.) was prepared with an exposure amount that makes a continuous tone wedge to be 3 steps, and then printing was conducted on a printing machine (Heidel GTO) wherein a coated paper, printing ink Hyplus (M) magenta (made by Toyo Ink Manufacturing Co.) and dampening water (2.5% SEU-3 aqueous solution made by Konica Corp.) were used, in which stain (developability) on a non-image area of a print at the initial stage in printing (at a point of time of about 3000 prints) was evaluated. In addition, printing durability was further evaluated by continuing printing until the moment when printing defect appears on a solid portion of a print and by counting the number of prints printed up to aforesaid moment. With regard to storage stability, prior to exposure and  processing including development, a presensitized lithographic printing plate was stored, under the condition of 55\u00b0C/20% RH, for 3 days (DT-3) and 5 days (DT-5), or in a thermostatic chamber (made by TABI ESPEC CORP), under the condition of high humidity such as accelerated aging of 40\u00b0C/80%, for 3 days (HT-3) and 5 days (HT-5). After that, the presensitized lithographic printing plate was subjected to exposure and development, and its developability after storage on a non-image area was evaluated. For evaluation of sensitivity, on the other hand, a presensitized lithographic printing plate was wound around a drum so that a protective layer faces the light source, and was exposed to a 30 mW argon ion laser beam while the drum was rotating, in which the rate of rotation of the drum was kept constant under the assumption that the laser beam intensity was on Gaussian distribution, and light intensity (\u00b5W/cm 2 ) wherein a line width of the formed image is the same as that corresponding to 1/e 2  of intensity of the laser beam was obtained so that it was multiplied by irradiation time to obtain the energy value.

{"docid": "EP0762208A2", "title": "Light sensitive composition, presensitized lithographic printing plate and image forming method employing the printing plate", "text": "FIELD OF THE INVENTION The present invention relates to a photopolymerizable  light-sensitive composition, a presensitized lithographic  printing plate having therein a light-sensitive layer composed  of the light-sensitive composition, and further to an image  forming method employing the presensitized lithographic  printing plate.  BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION A photopolymerizable composition has been used commonly  as an image forming layer of a negative working presensitized  lithographic printing plate. When applying the  photopolymerizable composition to a presensitized lithographic  printing plate, adhesiveness between an image forming layer     composed of a photopolymerizable composition and an aluminum  support is important and printing durability related to the  adhesiveness characteristics is also important.  However, compared with a presensitized lithographic  printing plate having a diazonium salt light-sensitive layer  used for an image forming layer of a negative working  presensitized lithographic printing plate which is commonly  put to practical use, a layer of a photopolymerizable  composition is extremely poor in terms of adhesiveness, which  is a weak point.  As a technology for overcoming the weak point mentioned  above, an aluminum support on which a phosphoric acid  anodizing film is formed is disclosed in Japanese Patent  Examined Publication No. 46-26521/1971 and an aluminum support  treated by polyvinyl phosphonic acid is disclosed in Japanese  Patent Examined Publication No. 46-35685/1971. However, layer  removal on a non-image area is insufficient and it causes  stain on a print, though the adhesiveness is improved for  aforesaid both cases. As another technology for overcoming the  aforesaid weak point, addition of diazonium salt to a layer of  a photopolymerizable composition and a subbing layer  containing a diazonium salt are disclosed in Japanese Patent  Examined Publication No. 50-7481/1975. However, these methods  are not only impossible to be used for direct plate making     wherein a laser beam or the like is used because diazonium  salt can not be subjected to spectral sensitization, but also  are undesirable from the environmental viewpoint.  Though there is disclosed a photopolymorizable  composition employing a benzophenone group-containing organic  peroxide and organic dyes in Japanese Patent O.P.I.  Publication No. 60-76503/1985, it has a problem that its  adhesiveness to a support is insufficient, though its  sensitivity is high.  Though there is disclosed a photopolymerizable  composition containing both acrylic binder containing 2 - 50  mol% of a glycidyl acrylate unit and polymerizable compound in  Japanese Patent O.P.I. Publication No. 61-148444/1986, it has  a problem that an image defect is caused because it is easily  affected by oxygen and thereby is deteriorated in terms of its  efficiency, and an unexposed portion sticks to a grained  support not to be dissolved in a developing solution.  In Japanese Patent O.P.I. Publication No. 2-84651/1990,  there is disclosed an invention to offer a light-sensitive  composition which has high sensitivity and is excellent in  storage stability and temperature dependency by employing a  photopolymerizable light-sensitive composition having a  polymer binder that includes an acrylic structure unit having  an acryl group on an end of the side chain. However, there has     been a problem of sensitivity drop caused by radical  production in course of time and of stain occurrence on non-image  portions.  Further, Japanese Patent O.P.I. Publication No. 2-289857/1990  discloses a technology for improving the  adhesiveness to a base plate by introducing a unit having a  reactive group in a copolymer having a carboxyl group. However,  there has been a problem of sensitivity drop caused by radical  production in course of time and of stain occurrence on non-image  portions.  SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION The first object of the invention is to provide a  photopolymerizable light-sensitive composition which, when  applied to a presensitized lithographic printing plate, is  excellent in sensitivity and printing durability, and makes it  possible to obtain a print with high quality and without stain  on a non-image area which produces in course of time, and is  free from sensitivity drop caused during a period of its  storage and further is capable of being written thereon with a  laser beam.  The second object of the invention is to provide an  image forming method employing a presensitized lithographic     printing plate having a layer of the aforesaid light-sensitive  composition.

The invention will be explained in detail below.

In Formula (1), the alkyl group represented by R 3   includes preferably an alkyl group having 1 to 7 carbon atoms  such as methyl or ethyl and the aryl group represented by R 3   includes preferably an aryl group having 6 to 10 carbon atoms  such as phenhyl or naphthyl.

Hymie Co.), and Megafac \"F-171\",  \"F-177\" (all are made by Dainihon Ink Kagaku Co.). The  fluorine content of the fluorine-containing surfactant in the  invention is 0.05 - 2% and preferably is 0.1 - 1%. The content  in to a protective layer of the surfactant preferably is 0.001  - 10%. Aforesaid fluoric surfactant can be used either  independently or in combination of two or more kinds thereof.  It can further be used in combination with other surfactants.  It is possible to make a protective layer of the invention  related to item 1 or 2 to contain other additives (for example,  antioxidant etc.). As a method for providing a protective  layer on a light-sensitive layer of a presensitized  lithographic printing plate of the invention, there may be  given a method of coating and a method of sticking together.  A presensitized lithographic printing plate of the  invention related to items (1) or item (2) (hereinafter     referred to as \"the present invention\") prepared as stated  above is first subjected to imagewise exposure conducted by  active light. As active light in this case, there can be used  any light provided that a photopolymerization starting agent  contained in aforesaid photopolymerizing and light-sensitive  composition can be exposed to the light, and there may be  given, for example, a mercury lamp, a xenon lamp and a laser  beam.  When applying a light-sensitive composition of the  invention to a light-sensitive layer of a presensitized  lithographic printing plate, it is preferable to use, as a  support, an aluminum support whose surface roughness on the  light-sensitive layer side is within a range of 0.4 - 0.8 in  terms of Ra and/or 3.0 - 6.0 in terms of Rz. When the surface  roughness is lower than 0.4 in terms of Ra, it lowers both  sensitivity and printing durability though it causes less  stain caused by storage. When the surface roughness exceeds  0.8, on the contrary, it worsens stain caused by storage  though it improves both sensitivity and printing durability.  When the surface roughness in terms of Rz is lower than 3.0,  it lowers both sensitivity and printing durability though it  causes less stain caused by storage, and when it exceeds 6.0,  on the contrary, it worsens stain caused by storage though it  improves both sensitivity and printing durability.   An aluminum plate used for a support of a presensitized  lithographic printing plate of the invention includes a pure  aluminum plate and an aluminum alloy plate. An aluminum alloy  to be used includes various ones wherein aluminum and each of  silicon, copper, manganese, chromium, zinc, lead, bismuth,  nickel, titanium, sodium and iron are alloyed.  In the invention, an aluminum plate is preferably  subjected to degreasing treatment for removing rolling oil on  the surface, prior to roughening. The degreasing treatment to  be used includes one employing a solvent such as trichlene or  thinner, and emulsion degreasing treatment employing an  emulsion such as kesilone and triethanol. It is also possible  to use an aqueous solution containing alkali such as caustic  soda for the degreasing treatment. When alkali aqueous  solution such as caustic soda is used for the degreasing  treatment, it is possible to remove even a stain and oxide  film which can not be removed by aforesaid degreasing  treatment alone.  When an aqueous solution containing alkali such as  caustic soda is used for the degreasing treatment, smut is  caused on the surface of a support. In this case, it is  preferable to perform desmutting treatment by dipping in an  acid such as phosphoric acid, nitric acid, sulfuric acid and  chromic acid, or in mixed acid thereof.   There is no limitation in particular for a mechanical  roughening method to be used, and a brush-roughening method  and a honing method are preferable. Roughening operation by  means of a brush-roughening method is conducted by pressing a  rotating rotary brush employing bristles each having a  diameter of 0.2 - 0.8 mm for example while supplying slurry  wherein particles of volcanic ashes each having a particle  size of 10 - 100 \u00b5m are dispersed uniformly in water, for  example, to the surface of a support. Roughening operation by  means of a honing method is conducted by causing, for example,  particles of volcanic ashes each having a particle size of 10  - 100 \u00b5m dispersed uniformly in water to be jetted under  pressure so that they are blasted slantwise on the surface of  a support. It is also possible to conduct roughening operation  by pasting on the surface of a support a sheet wherein  abrasive particles each having a particle size of 10 - 100 \u00b5m  are coated on the surface of a support so that they show a  particle distance of 100 - 200 \u00b5m and density of 2.5x10 3  -  10x10 3  pieces/cm 2 , and by applying pressure on them so that  patterns of the rough surface of the sheet may be transferred  onto the support.  It is preferable, after roughening a support through  aforesaid mechanical roughening method, to soak the support in  an aqueous solution containing an acid or alkali for the     purpose of removing abrasives used in the mechanical  roughening method and are pressed in the surface of the  support and of removing aluminum dust formed. An acid to be  used in this case includes a sulfuric acid, a persulfuric acid,  a hydrofluoric acid, a phosphoric acid, a nitric acid and a  hydrochloric acid, for example, and a base to be used includes  sodium hydroxide and potassium hydroxide, for example. Among  them, an alkali aqueous solution is preferable to be used. It  is preferable that an amount of aluminum dissolved in the  surface is 0.5 - 5 g/m 2 .

Though the electro-chemical roughening method can  generally be performed by impressing a voltage within a range  of 1 - 50 volts, it is preferable to select voltage to be  impressed from a range of 10 - 30 volts when finishing the  surface of an aluminum plate to be the same as the state of  the invention. Though a range of 10 - 200 A/dm 2  can be used  for current density, it is preferable to select it from a  range of 50 - 150 A/dm 2  when finishing the surface of an  aluminum plate to be the same as the state of the invention.  Though a range of 100 - 5000 c/dm 2  can be used for quantity of  electricity, it is preferable to select it from a range of 100  - 2000 c/dm 2 , further from a range of 200 - 1000 c/dm 2  when  finishing the surface of an aluminum plate to be the same as  the state of the invention.

Though a range of 100 - 5000 c/dm 2  can be used  for quantity of electricity, it is preferable to select it  from a range of 100 - 2000 c/dm 2  when finishing the surface of  an aluminum plate to be the same as the state of the invention.  Though a range of 10 - 50\u00b0C can be used for a temperature for  performing the electro-chemical roughening method, it is  preferable to select it from a range of 15 - 45\u00b0C when  finishing the surface of an aluminum plate to be the same as  the state of the invention.

In case of need, a nitrate, a  chloride, amines, aldehydes, a phosphoric acid, a chromic acid,  a boric acid, an acetic acid or an oxalic acid can be added to  an electrolyte.  When performing the electro-chemical roughening method  by using a nitric acid electrolyte as an electrolyte, it is  generally possible to perform it by impressing voltage within  a range of 1 - 50 volts. When finishing the surface of an  aluminum plate to be the same as the state of the invention,  however, it is preferable to select a voltage to be impressed     from a range of 2 - 30 volts. Though a range of 10 - 200 A/dm 2   can be used for current density, it is preferable to select it  from a range of 50 - 150 A/dm 2  when finishing the surface of an  aluminum plate to be the same as the state of the invention.

In case of need, a nitrate, a  chloride, amines, aldehydes, a phosphoric acid, a chromic acid,  a boric acid, an acetic acid or an oxalic acid can be added to  an electrolyte.  It is preferable, after roughening a support through  aforesaid mechanical roughening method, to soak the support in  an aqueous solution containing an acid or alkali for the  purpose of removing aluminum dust or the like staying on the  surface. An acid to be used in this case includes a sulfuric  acid, a persulfuric acid, a hydrofluoric acid, a phosphoric     acid, a nitric acid and a hydrochloric acid, for example, and  a base to be used includes sodium hydroxide and potassium  hydroxide, for example. Among them, an alkali aqueous solution  is preferable to be used. Among them, an alkali aqueous  solution is preferable to be used. It is preferable that an  amount of aluminum dissolved in the surface is 0.5 - 5 g/m 2 .  It is preferable, after performing the soaking treatment  with an alkali aqueous solution, to conduct neutralizing  treatment by soaking in an acid such as a phosphoric acid, a  nitric acid, a sulfuric acid or a chromic acid or in a mixed  acid of them.  Each of a mechanical roughening method and an electro-chemical  roughening method may be used independently for  roughening, or they may be used in combination for roughening  in a way that the electro-chemical roughening method follows  the mechanical roughening method. Treatment conditions for the  mechanical roughening method or the electro-chemical  roughening method are selected so that the finished surface  state of an aluminum plate may be the same as that of the  invention. The selection of the conditions can be made through  a simple experiment.  After the roughening treatment, there is conducted  anodizing treatment.   There is no limitation, in particular, for an anodizing  method usable in the invention, and known methods can be used.  Anodizing treatment forms an oxide film on a support. In the  invention, anodizing treatment employs preferably a method of  electrolyzing with current density of 1 - 10 A/dm 2  in an  electrolyte of an aqueous solution containing a sulfuric acid  and/or a phosphoric acid at 10 - 50% density. In addition to  that, a method of electrolyzing at high current density in a  sulfuric acid described in U.S. Patent No. 1,412,768 and a  method of electrolyzing by the use of a phosphoric acid  described in U.S. Patent No. 3,511,661 can be used.

The presensitized lithographic printing plate of the  invention may be provided with a protective layer containing  water-soluble resins which are dissolved at 1% or more in  water of 25\u00b0C. The water-soluble resin that can be used  includes, for example, polymers excellent in oxygen-interception  such as polyvinyl alcohol, polyvinylacetal,  maltotriose and acid cellulose. It is preferable that a  compound containing fluorine such as, for example, a fluorine     type surfactant, a nonionic surfactant, an anionic surfactant,  or a cationic surfactant is added to the protective layer.  In a method for obtaining a presensitized lithographic  printing plate of the invention, an aluminum plate is  subjected to roughening treatment and anodizing treatment so  that the surface of the aluminum plate may be finished to be  the specific state mentioned above, and a coating solution  wherein aforesaid light-sensitive composition is dissolved in  a solvent is coated on the surface of the aluminum plate so  that a layer containing a light-sensitive composition may be  provided thereon.  The solvent for dissolving the light sensitive  composition includes methylcellosolve, methylcellosolve  acetate, ethylcellosolve, ethylcellosolve acetate, diethylene  glycol monomethylether, diethylene glycol monoethylether,  diethylene glycol dimethylether, diethylene glycol  methylethylether, diethylene glycol diethylether, diethylene  glycol monoisopropylether, propylene glycol, propylene glycol  monoethylether acetate, propylene glycol monobutylether,  dipropylene glycol monomethylether, dipropylene glycol  dimethylether, dipropylene glycol methylethylether, ethyl  formate, propyl formate, butyl formate, amyl formate, methyl  acetate, ethyl acetate, propyl acetate, butyl acetate, methyl  propionate, ethyl propionate, methyl butyrate, ethyl butyrate,     dimethylformamide, dimethylsulfoxide, dioxane, acetone,  methylethylketone, cyclopentanone, cyclohexanone,  methylcyclohexanone, discetonealcohol, acetylacetone, \u03b3-butyrolactone.  These slovents can be used singly or in  combination.  The coating method for coating the light sensitive  composition on a support includes a conventional coating  method such as whirl coating, dip coating, air-knife coating,  spray coating, air-spray coating, static air-spray coating,  roll coating, blade coating or curtain coating. The coating  amount is preferably 0.05 to 5.0 g/m 2  as a solid, although the  amount varies depending on the usage.  When processing a presensitized lithographic printing  plate in the invention, conventional and ordinary methods are  used. Namely, a presensitized lithographic printing plate is  exposed through a transparent original image having therein a  line image and a screen image, and then is developed by a  water developing solution, thereby, it is possible to obtain a  negative relief image for the original image. A light source  of active light suitable for the exposure includes a carbon  arc lamp, a mercury lamp, a xenon lamp, a metal halide lamp, a  strobe, and a laser beam. A light-sensitive composition in the  invention is sufficiently sensitive to a visible laser beam     such as argon ion laser, and is preferably used for scanning  exposure conducted by the visible laser beam such as argon ion  laser based on digitized information.  When using an array-type light source such as a light-emitting  diode array, or when exposure-controlling a light  source such as a halogen lamp, a metal halide lamp and a  tungsten lamp with an optical shutter material such as a  liquid crystal or PLZT, digital exposure according to an image  signal can be performed. In this case, it is possible to write  in directly without using a mask blank.  In the case of a laser beam, it is suitable for writing  in directly without using a mask blank, because it is possible  to collimate the rays into a beam and thereby to conduct  scanning exposure in accordance with image data. When laser is  used ad a light source, it is easy to narrow down an exposure  area to be in a minimum size and thereby it is possible to  form an image with high resolution.  Laser sources used in the invention include, provided  that the laser source has its oscillation wavelength in a  visible light zone, well-known solid state laser such as YAG  laser and its second harmonic, gas laser such as He-Ne laser,  CO 2  laser, Ar ion laser, Kr ion laser and He-Cd laser, and  other discharged and excited molecule laser, excimer laser,  chemical laser, dye laser and semiconductor laser. Among them,     the second harmonic of YAG laser, He-Ne laser, semiconductor  laser and Ar ion laser are preferable.  Among semiconductor lasers, it is preferable to use the  so-called single mode laser diode as one wherein a 1/e 2   diameter is easily narrowed down to several \u00b5m - several tens  \u00b5m at a focal point without lowering optical efficiency  greatly.  A light source other than laser includes a light-emitting  diode (LED). The LED and semiconductor laser are  easily used as an array wherein a plurality of light-emitting  elements are integrated.  When a wavelength of 400 - 550 nm is required as that of  a light source, it is also possible to convert to a half-wave  length by combining semiconductor later and an element having  nonlinear optics effect or combining YAG laser and an element  having nonlinear optics effect.  A scanning method by means of a laser beam includes a  method of scanning on an outer surface of a cylinder, a method  of scanning on an inner surface of a cylinder and a method of  scanning on a plane. In the method of scanning on an outer  surface of a cylinder, laser beam exposure is conducted while  a drum around which a recording material is wound is rotated,  in which main scanning is represented by the rotation of the  drum, while sub-scanning is represented by the movement of the     laser beam. In the method of scanning on an inner surface of a  cylinder, a recording material is fixed on the inner surface  of a drum, a laser beam is emitted from the inside, and main  scanning is carried out in the circumferential direction by  rotating a part of or an entire part of an optical system,  while sub-scanning is carried out in the axial direction by  moving straight a part of or an entire part of the optical  system in parallel with a shaft of the drum. In the method of  scanning on a plane, main scanning by means of a laser beam is  carried out through a combination of a polygon mirror, a  galvano mirror and an F \ue70d lens, and sub-scanning is carried  out by moving a recording medium. The method of scanning on an  outer surface of a cylinder and the method of scanning on an  inner surface of a cylinder are more suitable for high density  recording because they make it easy to enhance a precision of  an optical system. In the case of the method of scanning on an  outer surface of a cylinder, it is easy to enhance a scanning  speed by raising the speed of rotation of a drum, but  enhancement of the speed of rotation tends to cause charging  on a recording material, resulting in attraction of dust which  creates an image defect.  In the case of the so-called multi-channel exposure  wherein a plurality of light-emitting elements are used     simultaneously, the method of scanning on an outer surface of  a cylinder is optimum.  The developer for developing a presensitized  lithographic printing plate using the light sensitive  composition of the invention may be any conventional developer,  and is preferably a solution containing a specific organic  solvent, an alkali agent and water as essential components.  The specific solvent herein referred to is a solvent having a  solubility in 20\u00b0C water of 10 weight % or less which is  capable of dissolving or swelling non-image portions of the  light sensitive layer in the developer containing the solvent.  Such a solvent may be any solvent, if the solvent has the  above characteristics, and the examples thereof includes  carboxylates such as ethyl acetate, propyl acetate, butyl  acetate, amyl acetate, benzyl acetate, ethylene glycol  monobutylacetate, butyl lactate and butyl levulinate, ketones  such as ethylbutyl ketone, methylisobutyl ketone and  cyclohexanone, alcohols such as ethylene glycol monobutylether,  ethylene glycol benzylether, ethylene glycol monophenylether,  benzyl alcohol, methylphenyl carbinol, n-amyl alcohol and  metyl amyl alcohol, an alkyl-substituted aromatic hydrocarbon  such as xylene and halogenated hydrocarbons such as methylene  dichloride, ethylene dichloride and monochlorobenzene. The  solvent may be used one kind or more. Among these solvents,     ethylene glycol monophenylether or benzyl alcohol is  especially preferable. The solvent content of the developer is  ordinarily 0.001 to 20 weight %, and preferably 0.01 to 10  weight %.  The alkali agent contained in the developer includes  sodium silicate, potassium silicate, sodium hydroxide,  potassium hydroxide, lithium hydroxide, a di or trisodium  phosphate, a di or triammonium phosphate, sodium metasilicate,  sodium carbonate, potassium carbonate, ammonia,  monomethylamine, dimethylamine, trimethylamine, monoethylamine,  diethylamine, triethylamine, monoisopropylamine,  diisopropylamine, n-butylamine, monoethanolamine,  diethanolamine, triethanolamine, monoisopropanolamine,  diisopropanolamine, triisopropanolamine, ethyleneamine and  ethylenediamine.  The preferable are potassium silicate, sodium silicate,  disodium phosphate, sodium carbonate, sodium bicarbonate,  potassium carbonate, monoethanolamine, diethanolamine and  triethanolamine. The alkali agent may be used singly or in  combination.  The ordinary content of these alkaline agents in a  developing solution is 0.05 - 8 wt% and preferable content is  0.5 - 6 wt%.   For further enhancement of storage stability and  printing durability, it is preferable to make water-soluble  sulfite to be contained in a developing solution as occasion  demands. As a sulfite of such type, an alkali metal sulfite or  an alkali earth metal sulfite is preferable, and there are  given, for example, sodium sulfite, potassium sulfite, lithium  sulfite and magnesium sulfite. Ordinary content of these  sulfites in a developing solution in terms of its composition  is 0.05 - 4 wt%, and preferable content is 0.1 - 1 wt%.  For accelerating dissolution of aforesaid specific  organic solvent in water, it is also possible to cause a  certain solubilizing agent to be contained. As the  solubilizing agent mentioned above, it is preferable to use  low molecular alcohol and ketones which are aoluble in water  more easily than the specific organic solvent to be used. It  is also possible to use anionic surfactants and ampholytic  surfactants. As alcohol and ketones mentioned above, it is  preferable to use methanol, ethanol, propanol, butanol,  acetone, methylethyl ketone, ethyleneglycol monomethyl ether,  ethyleneglycol monoethyl ether, methoxybutanol, ethoxybutanol,  4-methoxymethylbutanol and N-methylpyrrolidone, for example.  Further, as a surfactant, isopropyl naphthalene sodium  solfonate, n-butyl naphthalene sodium sulfonate, N-methyl-N-pentadecylamino  sodium acetate and lauryl sodium sulfate are     preferable. Though there is no limitation for an amount of the  solubilizing agent such as alcohol and ketones to be used, the  amount of about 30 wt% or less for the total of a developing  solution is generally preferable.  In the case of a presensitized lithographic printing  plate, when it is brought into contact with the developing  solution mentioned above, or it is rubbed further after it is  subjected imagewise exposure, light-sensitive composition on a  non-image portion can be removed thoroughly in 10 - 60 seconds  at about 10 - 40\u00b0C, without affecting adversely an exposed  portion on a light-sensitive layer.

Example 1 On 0.24-mm-thick aluminum support 1 subjected to  electrolytic roughening treatment employing hydrochloric acid,  and then to treatment for making the aluminum support to be  hydrophilic with sodium silicate, there was coated light-sensitive  solution 1 shown below by the use of a wire bar to  obtain a thickness of dried coating of 2.0 \u00b5m, and they were  dried for 2 minutes at 80\u00b0C under the condition of light-shielding  so that a light-sensitive layer was formed.  Light-sensitive solution 1 Vinyl type polymer 1 (binder 1) (MMA/EA/MAA/unit of Formula (1) = 70/20/9/1 (by weight) Mw : 30000) 35.0 parts by weight   3,3'-carbonylbis (diethylamino cumarine) 5.0 parts by weight  3,3',4,4'-tetrakis (t-butyldioxycarbonyl) benzophenone 3.0 parts by weight  DPHA/U324A (produced by Nakamura Co. Ltd.) 50.0 parts by weight  Phthalocyanine pigment (MHI454:made by Mikuni Shikiso) 1.0 part by weight  2-tert-butyl-6-(3-tert-butyl-2-hydroxy-5-methylbenzyl)-4-methylphenylacrylate 0.5 parts by weight  Fluorine-containing surfactant (FC-431 produced by Sumitomo-3M Co.

Further, an over-coat layer coating solution having the  following composition was coated by means of an applicator on  aforesaid light-sensitive layer in a way to get a thickness of  dried coating of 2.0 \u00b5m, and then, was dried for 3 minutes at  80\u00b0C under the condition of light-shielding. Thus,  presensitized lithographic printing plate 1 was obtained.  Over-coat layer coating solution   Polyvinyl alcohol (GL-05 made by Nihon Gosei Kagaku Co.) 99 parts by weight     Surfactant (F-12: made by Dainihon ink Co. Ltd.)   1 part by weight    Water 900 parts by weight  The presensitized lithographic printing plate 1 thus  prepared was subjected to exposure conducted by a daylight  room printer (P-627-HA made by Dainihon Screen Co.), then was  dipped in SDN-21(made by Konica Corp.) at 30\u00b0C for 30 seconds  so that a light-sensitive layer on an unexposed portion may be  dissolved out, and it was washed with water and dried so that  an image thus formed was evaluated. In evaluation of printing  durability, an image of Ugra plate control wedge PCW82 (made  by Mika Denshi Co.) was prepared with an exposure amount that  makes a continuous tone wedge to be 3 steps, and then printing  was conducted on a printing machine (Heidel GTO) wherein a  coated paper, printing ink Hyplus (M) magenta made by Toyo Ink  Manufacturing Co.) and dampening water (2.5% SEU-3 aqueous  solution made by Konica Corp.) were used, in which stain  (developability) on a non-image area of a print at the initial  stage in printing (at a point of time of about 3000 prints)  was evaluated. In addition, printing durability was further  evaluated by continuing printing until the moment when  printing defect appears on a solid portion of a print and by  counting the number of prints printed up to aforesaid moment.  With regard to storage stability, prior to exposure and     processing including development, a presensitized lithographic  printing plate was stored, under the condition of 55\u00b0C/20% RH,  for 3 days (DT-3) and 5 days (DT-5), or in a thermostatic  chamber (made by TABI ESPEC CORP), under the condition of high  humidity such as accelerated aging of 40\u00b0C/80%, for 3 days  (HT-3) and 5 days (HT-5). After that, the presensitized  lithographic printing plate was subjected to exposure and  development, and its developability after storage on a non-image  area was evaluated. For evaluation of sensitivity, on  the other hand, a presensitized lithographic printing plate  was wound around a drum so that a protective layer faces the  light source, and was exposed to a 30 mW algon ion laser beam  while the drum was rotating, in which the rate of rotation of  the drum was kept constant under the assumption that the laser  beam intensity was on Gaussian distribution, and light  intensity (\u00b5W/cm 2 ) wherein a line width of the formed image is  the same as that corresponding to 1/e 2  of intensity of the  laser beam was obtained so that it was multiplied by  irradiation time to obtain the energy value.

The aluminum plate  thus degreased was dipped in a 10% hydrochloric acid aqueous  solution kept at 25\u00b0C for one minute to be neutralized, and  then was washed with water. After being roughened     electrolytically under conditions shown in Table 2, the  aluminum plate was subjected to desmutting treatment for 10  seconds in a 5% sodium hydroxide aqueous solution kept at 60\u00b0C.  The aluminum plate thus desmutted and roughened was subjected  to anodizing treatment for one minute in a 15% sulfuric acid  aqueous solution under the conditions of temperature 25\u00b0C,  current density 10A/dm 2  and voltage 15V, and was further  subjected to sealing at 90\u00b0C in a 3% sodium silicate solution.  Thus, aluminum supports 2 - 6 were prepared.

{"docid": "EP1096314A1", "title": "Lithographic printing plate precursor", "text": "FIELD OF THE INVENTION This invention relates to a lithographic printing plate precursor comprising a photopolymerizable composition. More particularly, it relates to a negatively working lithographic printing plate precursor having high sensitivity to visible light, high mechanical strength and, especially, excellent highlight characteristics. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Negatively working lithographic printing plate precursors are widely known and include various types according to the photosensitive layer, such as a diazo resin-containing type, a photopolymerizable type, and photo-crosslinkable type. A lithographic printing plate is generally produced front these negatively working lithographic printing plate precursors by imagewise exposure to ultraviolet light with a transparent negative film original (lith film) in contact with the photosensitive layer, which is a laborious and time-consuming process. The recent development of image formation techniques has enabled production of a printing plate without using a film original. For example, a printing plate precursor having a highly sensitive photopolymerizable layer fit for non-contact projection alignment or visible laser beam scanning is scanned  with a laser beam of small diameter to directly form an image. However, conventional printing plates of this type do not necessarily have strong adhesion between the photosensitive layer and the support and tend to produce such defects as missing of a solid image, a fine line or a highlight when used for high-speed large-volume printing Further, when a printing plate as mounted on a printing machine is wiped with a plate cleaner to remove ink scum in the course of printing, the highlight tends to come off because of weak adhesion to the support. In large-volume printing, too, the weak adhesion to the support also causes fine lines and highlights to successively varnish as in the case of wiping with a plate cleaner. There have recently been keen market demands that the exposure time be shortened for improvement of productivity and that the laser be used at a lower output for extension of its service life. It is a perennial subject in the art to increase the sensitivity of a lithographic printing plate precursor capable of direct platemaking. However, under the present situation it is very difficult to develop a photopolymerizable lithographic printing plate or a precursor thereof which has higher sensitivity and sufficient adhesion between the photosensitive layer and the support thereby retaining its initial tone reproducibility even when wiped with a plate cleaner in the course of printing or when used for producing  hundred thousands of prints and also which is resistant to staining. JP-B-2712564 proposes incorporating a polyurethane resin having an allyl group into a photosensitive layer as a binder for the purpose of improving abrasion resistance. However, application of the disclosed technique fails to obtain a lithographic printing plate precursor with sufficient characteristics.  SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION Accordingly, an object of the present invention is to provide a negatively working photopolymerizable lithographic printing plate precursor having high sensitivity and strong adhesion between the photosensitive layer and the support and capable of direct writing with a laser thereby providing a lithographic printing plate which is excellent in press life and stain resistance and does not suffer from missing of fine lines or highlights. As a result of extensive investigation, the present inventors have found that the above object of the invention is accomplished by incorporating an alkali-soluble urethane binder having at least one ethylenically unsaturated polymerizable group in the side chain thereof as a binder component of a photopolymerizable photosensitive layer. The present invention provides a lithographic printing plate precursor comprising an aluminum support having thereon a photopolymerizable photosensitive layer which contains (1) an alkali-soluble urethane binder having at least one ethylenically unsaturated polymerizable group on the side chain thereof, (2) an addition polymerizable compound having an ethylenically unsaturated double bond, and (3) a photopolymerization initiator.  In a highly preferred embodiment of the invention, the urethane binder is a reaction product between (A) an ethylenically unsaturated group-containing diisocyanate compound obtained by allowing (A1) a compound having three or more isocyanate groups per molecule and (A2) an ethylenically unsaturated compound having an active hydrogen atom to react and (B) a diol compound having an alkali-soluble group. While the mechanism of action of the urethane binder according to the invention is not necessarily clear, it is considered that the ethylenically unsaturated polymerizable group in the side chain causes the urethane binder itself to undergo radical polymerization to afford a denser crosslinked structure. According to JP-B-2712564, on the other hand, since the side chain possessed by the urethane binder is an allyl group, the urethane binder itself does not undergo such a radical polymerization reaction as to form a sufficiently dense crosslinked structure.  DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION [I] Alkali-soluble urethane binder having at least one ethylenically unsaturated polymerizable group in the side chain The urethane binder, which is to be incorporated into the photopolymerizable photosensitive layer of the lithographic printing plate precursor according to the invention, is the most essential element of the present invention. While the urethane binder is not particularly limited as long as it is alkali-soluble and carries at least one ethylenically unsaturated polymerizable group in its side chain, it is preferably a polyurethane resin obtained by the reaction between (A) a diisocyanate compound containing an ethylenically unsaturated group and (B) a diol compound containing an alkali-soluble group. (A) Ethylenically unsaturated group-containing diisocyanate compound The method of obtaining the ethylenically unsaturated group-containing diisocyanate compound (A) is not particularly restricted. For example, it is obtainable by allowing (A1) a compound having three or more isocyanate groups (hereinafter simply referred to as a polyisocyanate compound) and (A2) an ethylenically unsaturated compound having an active hydrogen group to react in such a manner as to leave two isocyanate groups of the polyisocyanate compound unreacted.  Where the polyisocyanate compound (A1) is a triisocyanate compound having three isocyanate groups, it is allowed to addition react with an equivalent of an ethylenically unsaturated compound having one active hydrogen group. Where the polyisocyanate compound is a tetraisocyanate compound having four isocyanate groups, it is allowed to addition react with two equivalents of an ethylenically unsaturated compound having one active hydrogen group or an equivalent of an ethylenically unsaturated compound having two active hydrogen groups. The polyisocyanate compound is not particularly limited, but a triisocyanate compound is preferred for its availability. Suitable triisocyanate compounds are shown below.  The ethylenically unsaturated compound having an active hydrogen group (A2) is not particularly limited. Useful ones include monofunctional alcohol or amine compounds having an ethylenically unsaturated group.

The compounds presented as a photocuring monomer or oligomer in Nippon Secchaku Kyokaishi vol. 20, No. 7, pp. 300-308 (1984) are also useful.  The particulars of usage of these addition polymerizable compounds as to the structure and the amount to be used, whether they are used individually or in combination, and the like can arbitrarily be determined according to the performance design of a finished lithographic printing plate. For example, the particulars are decided from the following viewpoint. From the standpoint of photosensitive speed, structures with a higher unsaturated group content per molecule are preferred. In many cases, bi- or higher functionality is preferred. To obtain high film strength on curing, tri- or higher functionality is desirable. It is an effective manipulation to use a plurality of addition polymerizable compounds different in functionality or polymerizable group (e.g., acrylic esters, methacrylic esters, styrene compounds, and vinyl ether compounds) to have the photosensitivity and the film strength controlled in balance. Addition polymerizable compounds having a large molecular weight or high hydrophobic properties are, while excellent in photosensitive speed or film strength, sometimes unfavorable for developing speed or tend to precipitate in a developer. Further, compatibility and dispersibility with other components of the photosensitive layer (such as a binder, a titanocene compound used as a photopolymerization initiator, a colorant, etc.) are also important factors to be taken into consideration in selecting the kind and usage of the addition polymerizable compound. For  example, compatibility could be improved by use of a low purity compound or a combined use of two or more compounds. A specific compound structure could be chosen for the purpose of improving adhesion to the support, a topcoat, etc. Although a higher compounding ratio of the addition polymerizable compound in the photosensitive layer is more effective on sensitivity, too much the compound can cause unfavorable phase separation or make the film sticky (stickiness can cause troubles in the production process, such as rejection due to transfer of the photosensitive layer components or blocking of the photosensitive layer) or precipitate in a developer. From these viewpoints, a preferred ratio of the addition polymerizable compound is 5 to 80% by weight, particularly 25 to 75% by weight, based on the total weight of the photosensitive layer components.

Sufficient photosensitivity will be secured by using 0.5 to 80 parts by weight, preferably 1 to 50 parts by weight, of the radical generator per 100 parts by weight of the photosensitive layer components.  The photopolymerizable photosensitive layer can contain a sensitizing dye in combination with the photopolymerization initiator.

Specific examples of the benzopyran dyes are shown below.  Preferred of the above-described sensitizing dyes are the merocyanine dyes (b) and the benzopyran dyes (e). The sensitizing dyes can be used either individually or in combination of two or more thereof. Various chemical modifications can be made to the sensitizing dyes for the purpose of improving the characteristics of the photosensitive layer. For example, the aforementioned addition polymerizable compound structure (e.g., an acryloyl group or a methacryloyl group) can be bonded to the sensitizing dye through covalent bonding, ionic bonding or hydrogen bonding to enhance the film strength after exposure or to inhibit unnecessary precipitation of the dye from the exposed film. The radical generating part of the aforementioned radical generator or other radical generating part (e.g., a reduction-decomposable moiety such as an alkyl halide, an onium, a peroxide or a biimidazole moiety; or an oxidation-cleavege moiety such as a borate, an amine, a trimethylsilylmethyl, a carboxymethyl, a carbonyl or an mine moiety) can be bonded to the sensitizing dye to markedly improve the photosensitivity particularly in a low concentration of a photopolymerization initiation system. Introduction of a hydrophilic moiety (e.g., an acid radical or a polar group, such as a carboxyl group or an ester thereof, a sulfonic acid group or an ester thereof, and an ethylene oxide group) is effective in enhancing suitability to processing with an (alkali) aqueous  developer which is a preferred embodiment of the use of the photosensitive layer. In particular, a hydrophilic group of ester type is characterized by excellent compatibility in the photosensitive layer owing to its relatively hydrophobic structure and by capability of generating an acid radical on hydrolysis in the developer thereby to gain in hydrophilic properties. Further, appropriate substituents can be introduced to the sensitizing dye to improve the compatibility in the photosensitive layer and to inhibit precipitation. For example, an unsaturated bond of an aryl group, an allyl group, etc. is very effective in improving compatibility in some photosensitive systems. Introduction of a steric hindrance between \u03c0-planes of a dye by, for example, introduction of a branched alkyl structure is effective in markedly inhibiting crystal precipitation. Introduction of a phosphonic acid group, an epoxy group, a trialkoxysilyl group, etc. brings about improved adhesion to inorganic substances such as metal or metal oxides. Polymerization of the sensitizing dye is also effective for some purposes. Similarly to the radical generators, the usage of the sensitizing dyes can arbitrarily be decided according to the performance design of the lithographic printing plate precursor. For example, a combination of two or more sensitizing dyes will have improved compatibility in the photosensitive layer. In making a choice of the sensitizing dyes, the molar absorptivity  at the wavelength of the light emitted from the light source used as well as photosensitivity are important factors. Dyes having a larger molar absorptivity are effective at a lower amount, which is not only economical but advantageous for the film properties. Because the photosensitivity and resolution of the photosensitive layer and the physical properties of the layer after exposure are largely influenced by the absorbance of the layer at the light source wavelength, the amount of the sensitizing dyes to be added should be decided appropriately with these factors taken into consideration. For example, a photosensitive layer whose absorbance is 0.1 or smaller has a low sensitivity and also exhibits a low resolving power due to the influence of halation. On the other hand, for the purpose of hardening a thick film of 5 \u00b5m or greater, such a low absorbance is sometimes rather effective in increasing the degree of hardening. Where the absorbance of a photosensitive layer is as high as 3 or more, most of light will be absorbed by the surface portion of the photosensitive layer so that hardening inside the layer may be hindered, which results in insufficient film strength and insufficient adhesion to the support for use as a printing plate. Where a photosensitive layer has a relatively small film thickness, the sensitizing dyes are preferably added in such an amount that the photosensitive layer may have an absorbance of from 0.1 to 1.5, particularly 0.25 to 1, which generally corresponds to 0.05 to  30 parts by weight, preferably 0.1 to 20 parts by weight, still preferably 0.2 to 10 parts by weight, per 100 parts by weight of the photosensitive layer components. For the purpose of improving the sensitivity, the photopolymerizable photosensitive layer can contain a co-initiator, such as amine compounds, thiol compounds, and oxime ether compounds. Preferred examples of the oxime ether compounds include, but are not limited to, those having formula (I):   wherein R 1 , R 2 , R 3 , and R 4  each represent an alkyl group or an aryl group; Ar represents an aryl group; R 1  and R 2 , or R 3  and R 4  may be taken together to form a ring; Z represents a substituted or unsubstituted divalent linking group containing a hydrocarbon group; Y represents a single bond or a divalent linking group containing at least one of:   (wherein R 5  represents a hydrogen atom, a substituted or unsubstituted saturated or unsaturated hydrocarbon group, a carbonyl group or a sulfonyl group; R 5 , R 6 , R 7  and R 8 , which may be the same or different, each represent a substituted or unsubstituted saturated or unsaturated hydrocarbon group; T -  represents a halide anion or a sulfonate anion);  and X represents an addition polymerizable group represented by formula (I-a):   (wherein D represents    r 1 , r 2 , and r 3 , which may be the same or different, each represent a hydrogen atom, a methyl group, an ethyl group, a phenyl group, a halogen atom, a cyano group or -C(=O)-OR 9 ; n represents 0 or 1; provided that when n=0 r 1 , r 2 , and r 3  do not simultaneously represent a hydrogen atom; r 4  and r 5 , which may be the same or different, each represent a hydrogen atom, a methyl group, an ethyl group or a phenyl group; and R 9  represent an alkyl group or an aryl group). Specific examples of the oxime ether compounds are listed in Table 2 below.  The above-described oxime ether compounds are particularly preferred co-initiators. Similarly to the sensitizing dyes, various chemical modifications can be made to the co-initiators to bring about improvements on the characteristics of the photosensitive layer. Conceivable chemical modifications include binding to the sensitizing dye, the radical generator, the addition polymerizable unsaturated compound or other radical generating parts, introduction of a hydrophilic moiety, introduction of a substituent for compatibility improvement or precipitation inhibition, introduction of a substituent for adhesion improvement, and polymerization. The co-initiators can be used either individually or as a combination of two or more thereof. The co-initiators are suitably added in an amount of 0.05 to 100 parts by weight, preferably 1 to 80 parts by weight, still preferably 3 to 50 parts by weight, per 100 parts by weight of the ethylenically unsaturated group-containing compound. It is preferred for the photopolymerizable photosensitive layer of the lithographic printing plate precursor to further contain a small amount of a thermal polymerization inhibitor to inhibit unnecessary thermal polymerization of the addition polymerizable compound during preparation or storage of the composition for forming the photosensitive layer. Suitable thermal polymerization  inhibitors are hydroquinone, p-methoxyphenol, di-t-butyl-p-cresol, pyrogallol, t-butylcatechol, benzoquinone, 4,4'-thiobis(3-methyl-6-t-butylphenol), 2,2'-methylenebis(4-methyl-6-t-butylphenol), N-nitrosophenylhydroxylamine primary cerium salt, and N-nitrosophenylhydroxylamine aluminum salt. The thermal polymerization inhibitor is preferably added in an amount of about 0.01 to 5% by weight based on the total weight of the composition. If desired, a higher fatty acid or a derivative thereof, such as behenic acid or its amide, etc. may be added to the composition and be localized in the surface portion of the photosensitive layer after drying so as to prevent polymerization hindrance by oxygen. The higher fatty acid (or a derivative thereof) is preferably added in an amount of about 0.5 to 10% by weight based on the total composition. The photopolymerizable photosensitive layer can be colored by addition of a colorant. Useful colorants include pigments such as phthalocyanine pigments (C.I. Pigment Blue 15:3, 15:4 or 15:6), azo pigments, carbon black, and titanium oxide; and dyes such as Ethyl Violet, Crystal Violet, azo dyes, anthraquinone dyes, and cyanine dyes. The colorants are preferably added in an amount of about 0.5 to 20% by weight based on the total composition.  The composition can further contain customary additives, such as inorganic fillers and plasticizers (e.g., dioctyl phthalate, dimethyl phthalate, and tricresyl phosphate) to improve the physical properties of the hardened film. The amount of the additives is preferably not more than 10% by weight based on the total composition. The photopolymerizable photosensitive layer can be formed by coating a support (hereinafter described in detail) with a coating composition comprising the above-mentioned various essential and optional components as dissolved in an appropriate organic solvent. Examples of solvents suitable for coating are acetone, methyl ethyl ketone, cyclohexane, ethyl acetate, ethylene dichloride, tetrahydrofuran, toluene, ethylene glycol monomethyl ether, ethylene glycol monoethyl ether, ethylene glycol dimethyl ether, propylene glycol monomethyl ether, propylene glycol monoethyl ether, acetylacetone, cyclohexanone, diacetone alcohol, ethylene glycol monomethyl ether acetate, ethylene glycol ethyl ether acetate, ethylene glycol monoisopropyl ether, ethylene glycol monobutyl ether acetate, 3-methoxypropanol, methoxymethoxyethanol, diethylene glycol monomethyl ether, diethylene glycol monoethyl ether, diethylene glycol dimethyl ether, diethylene glycol diethyl ether, propylene glycol monomethyl ether acetate, propylene glycol monoethyl ether acetate, 3-methoxypropyl acetate, N, N-dimethylformamide,  dimethyl sulfoxide, \u03b3-butyrolactone, methyl lactate, and ethyl lactate. These solvents can be used either individually or as a mixture thereof. The solvent is suitably used in such an amount to as give a solids concentration of 1 to 50% by weight. The coating composition can contain a surface active agent to improve the coating properties. The coating composition is suitably applied to the support to a dry coating weight of about 0.1 to 10 g/m 2 , preferably 0.3 to 5 g/m 2 , still preferably 0.5 to 3 g/m 2 . [IV] Aluminum support The aluminum support which can be used in the invention is selected from a plate made of pure aluminum, which is stable in dimensions, or an aluminum alloy containing a trace amount of other elements and a plastic film or paper laminated or deposited with aluminum or an aluminum alloy. A composite sheet comprising a polyethylene terephthalate film and an aluminum sheet as described in JP-B-48-18327 also serves as an aluminum support. In what follows, the above-mentioned unfinished plate comprising aluminum or an aluminum alloy will be inclusively referred to as an aluminum plate. The alloying elements that can constitute the aluminum alloy include silicon, iron, manganese, copper, magnesium, chromium, zinc, bismuth, nickel, and titanium. The total amount of these hetero elements is not more than 10% by weight. While a pure aluminum plate is suitable,  existence of a trace amount of hetero elements is acceptable because of technical difficulty in obtaining pure aluminum. That is, the aluminum plate to be used in the invention is not specified in its composition, and known materials that have been conventionally used in the art, such as JIS A1050, JIS A1100, JIS A3103, and JIS A3005, can be utilized. The thickness of the aluminum plate is subject to variation according to the size of the printing machine, the size of the printing plate or users' demand and preferably ranges from about 0.1 to 0.6 mm. An aluminum plate having the following surface properties is particularly preferred for use in the present invention.

(iii) Surface density Value L * : 40 to 80 (as measured with a color difference meter) Density: 0.15 to 0.35 (as measured with a Macbeth densitometer)       (Silicate treatment) The aluminum plate is subjected to a surface graining treatment, etc. (hereinafter described in detail), followed by a treatment with a silicate for making the surface water-wettable. The silicate treatment conducted in the present invention is formation of a silicate film having a silicon content of 0.5 to 40 mg/m 2 , preferably 1 to 30 mg/m 2 . The amount of silicon applied onto the aluminum plate can be measured by X-ray fluorescence analysis.  The silicate treatment can be carried out conveniently by immersing an aluminum plate having been subjected to anodizing in an aqueous solution of an alkali metal silicate as taught in JP-B-47-5125. The method disclosed in U.S. Patents 2,714,066, 3,181,461, 3,280,734, and 3,902,734, which uses an alkali metal silicate (e.g., a sodium silicate aqueous solution), is also applicable. According to the disclosed method, an aluminum plate having an anodized layer is immersed in an alkali metal silicate aqueous solution having a concentration of 1 to 30% by weight, preferably 2 to 15% by weight, and a pH of 10 to 13 (25\u00b0) at, e.g., 15 to 80\u00b0C for 0.5 to 120 seconds. The alkali metal silicates useful for the silicate treatment include sodium silicate, potassium silicate, and lithium silicate. The pH of the alkali silicate aqueous solution is adjusted with sodium hydroxide, potassium hydroxide, lithium hydroxide, etc. The alkali silicate aqueous solution may contain an alkaline earth metal salt or a salt of a metal of the group IVB. The alkaline earth metal salt includes water-soluble salts, such as nitrates (e.g., calcium nitrate, strontium nitrate, magnesium nitrate, and barium nitrate) , sulfates, hydrochlorides, phosphates, acetates, oxalates, and borates.  The group IVB metal salts include titanium tetrachloride, titanium trichloride, potassium titanium fluoride, potassium titanium oxalate, titanium sulfate, titanium tetraiodide, zirconium oxychloride, zirconium dioxide, and zirconium tetrachloride. The alkaline earth metal salts or the group IVB metal salts can be used either individually or as a combination of two or more thereof. These metal salts are preferably added in an amount of 0.01 to 10% by weight, particularly 0.05 to 5.0% by weight. Silicate electrodeposition as described in U.S. Patent 3,658,662 is also an effective silicate treatment for making the aluminum plate water-wettable. A combination of an anodizing treatment and a sodium silicate treatment on an electrolytically grained aluminum plate as disclosed in JP-B-46-27481, JP-A-52-58602, and JP-A-52-30503 is also useful. (Acid treatment) The silicate-treated aluminum plate is then treated with an acidic solution to improve adhesion to a photopolymerizable photosensitive layer. Acids used for the acid treatment include hydrochloric acid, sulfuric acid, nitric acid, phosphoric acid, oxalic acid, chromic acid, sulfamic acid, benzenesulfonic acid, etc. and mixtures thereof. A preferred pH of the acidic solution is 0 to 6. Acidic solutions at a lower pH than 0 are dangerous to handle, and those at a higher pH than  6 fail to sufficiently improve adhesion. The acid treatment is suitably carried out at a temperature of 10 to 80\u00b0C for an immersion time of 1 to 300 seconds. While not clear, the reason why an acid treatment improves adhesion seems to be as follows. It has been confirmed by X-ray fluorescence analysis or electron spectroscopy for chemical analysis (ESCA) that the acid treatment reduces the silicate having been adsorbed by 5 to 30% and also reduces metal ions which are present in small amounts in the silicate film, e.g., Na and Ca. Further, in order to estimate the SiOH amount of the silicate film, the inventors treated the film with 1N Na 2 CO 3  at 25\u00b0C for 10 seconds to convert SiOH into SiONa, and after washing with distilled water and drying, measured the Na content by ESCA. As a result, it was found that the acid treatment results in increase of Na. In other words, it is considered that the acid treatment increases the SiOH content on the silicate film surface. It has also been found that an aluminum support prepared by subjecting the aluminum plate to a series of treatments up to the acid treatment exhibits considerably reduced dyeability when allowed to stand in a 0.5% aqueous solution of Crystal Violet, which is a cationic dye, for 12 hours as compared with an aluminum plate having been subjected to the same treatments except an acid treatment. This implies that the acid treatment reduces the negative charges on the film surface to make the  surface less capable of adsorbing Crystal Violet, a cationic dye. That is, the acid treatment reduces the metal ions (Na, Ca, etc.) present in small amounts on the silicate surface and increases an SiOH content to provide increased sites for chemical bonding to an adhesive layer applied thereon (hereinafter described), which seems to account for the improved adhesion between the aluminum support and the photopolymerizable photosensitive layer. (Adhesive layer) The silicate-treated and acid-treated aluminum plate is coated with an adhesive layer containing a silicone compound having a functional group capable of radical-induced addition reaction (hereinafter referred to an addition-reactive functional group). The adhesive layer containing a silicone compound having an addition-reactive functional group is preferably formed by using an organosilicone compound as a starting material. Specifically, an organosilicone compound represented by formula (40):  R 18 Si(OR 19 ) 3  wherein R 18  represents an addition-reactive functional group; and -OR 19  represents a hydrolyzable alkoxy group or -OCOCH 3 ,  is applied to the aluminum plate and allowed to react with a metal, a metal oxide, a hydroxide, a hydroxyl group, a silanol group formed through a chemical treatment of the plate, and the like to form a covalent bond with the surface of the plate, whereby a functional group represented by formula (41):  (R 20 O) 2 (R 18 )Si-  wherein R 18  is as defined above; and R 20  represents an alkyl group, either the same as or different from the alkyl moiety R 19 , a hydrogen atom or a bond to another Si atom, is bonded to or implanted into the plate surface. In place of the compound of formula (40), organosilicone compounds having two or three addition-reactive functional groups R 18 's bonded to the center Si atom which are represented by formula (42) or (43):  (R 18 ) 2 Si(OR 19 ) 2 (R 18 ) 3 SiOR 19  wherein R 18  and R 19  are as defined above, are also useful.  Organosilicone compounds having four addition-reactive functional groups R 18 's which are represented by formula (44):  (R 18 ) 4 Si  are also useful. In this case a functional group having the addition-reactive functional groups R 18 's bonded to the center Si atom via an oxygen atom is bonded or implanted to the aluminum plate. The organosilicone compound of formula (40) should be applied to the aluminum plate while at least one of the three OR 19' s bonded to the center Si atom remains non-hydrolyzed. The organosilicone compound of formula (40) can be applied as such or, if desired, as diluted with an appropriate solvent. Water and/or a catalyst can be added to have the organosilicone compound bonded to the aluminum plate more firmly. Useful solvents include alcohols, such as methanol, ethanol, propanol, isopropyl alcohol, ethylene glycol, and hexylene glycol. Useful catalysts include acids, such as hydrochloric acid, acetic acid, phosphoric acid, and sulfuric acid, and bases, such as ammonia and tetramethylammonium hydroxide.  The amount (number) of the addition-reactive functional group bonded onto the aluminum plate is usually 0.01 to 1000, preferably 0.05 to 200, still preferably 0.1 to 50, per 10 nm 2 , while varying according to the kind of the functional group. Less than 0.01 addition-reactive functional group per 10 nm 2  may fail to give sufficient photo-adhesion strength. It is possible to increase the amount of the addition-reactive functional groups per unit area by repeatedly applying the organosilicone compound to form a thick layer, but too large a coating thickness would be a waste because only about 10 addition-reactive functional groups per 10 nm 2  could be exposed at the most on the surface. Considering that too many addition-reactive functional groups on an aluminum support tend to cause insufficient water wettability of non-image areas of a lithographic printing plate, a suitable number of the addition-reactive functional group is within 1000 per 10 nm 2 . Accordingly, when the organosilicone compound is applied to provide the aluminum plate with the addition-reactive functional groups, it is required to select various process parameters so that the amount of the functional groups per unit area may fall within the above range. The process parameters include the kind and amount of a solvent for diluting the organosilicone compound, the amount of water if added for hydrolysis on the aluminum plate, the kind and amount of a catalyst if added for accelerating hydrolysis on the plate, the  method of applying the organosilicone compound (solution), the conditions of drying after application (e.g., atmosphere, temperature and time), and so forth. The amount of the addition-reactive functional groups held on the aluminum support is obtained from the surface Si atom content, the surface carbon-carbon multiple bond content, etc. as quantitatively determined by an appropriate method, for example, X-ray fluorescence analysis or infrared absorption analysis. In the above-described manner, an anodized layer and a silicate film are formed on the aluminum plate, and addition-reactive functional groups are bonded to the surface to complete the support for use in the invention. It is noted, however, that a lithographic printing plate prepared by using the resulting support, which can be said to be an addition-reactive support, tends to suffer from ink staining as follows. A lithographic printing plate is prepared by imagewise exposing the photopolymerizable photosensitive layer of a printing plate precursor to cause interfacial photo-adhesion in the exposed areas, removing the unexposed photosensitive layer with a developer to leave the photopolymerized film adhered to the support in the light pattern. On applying ink and water to the printing plate thus produced, ink adheres to the image areas (exposed areas), and water to the non-image areas (unexposed areas). Where the above-described  organosilicone compound is used alone to provide the addition-reactive functional groups, an excess of the organic functional groups may tend to exist on the unexposed areas, making the unexposed areas receptive to not only water but printing ink, which is observed as stains on printed matter. In order to prevent such stains, it is therefore desirable to fix many hydroxyl groups onto the aluminum plate in addition to the addition-reactive functional groups (R 18 ). This can be achieved by using, in combination with the organosilicone compound of formula (40): R 18 Si(OR 19 ) 3 , an organosilicone compound represented by formula (45):  Si(OR 21 ) 4  wherein -OR 21  represents a hydrolyzable group selected from an alkoxy group, an alkoxyalkoxy group, an aryloxy group and -OCOCH 3  R 21  may be the same as or different from R 19 , so that hydrophilic sites represented by formula (46):  (R 22 O) 2 (OH)Si-  wherein R 22  represents an alkyl group, a hydrogen atom or a bond to another Si atom, as well as the reactive sites represented by formula (41) may be bonded to the surface of the aluminum plate. From the standpoint of hydrophilicity (water  wettability), R 22  in formula (46) is most preferably a hydrogen atom. Where R 22  is other than a hydrogen atom, the surface of the plate may be washed with an alkali solution to enhance the water wettability if necessary. The mixing ratio of the organosilicone compound of formula (40) and the organosilicone compound of formula (45) cannot be specified generally because the bonding (implanting) efficiency of the respective functional groups varies depending on the surface chemical properties of the aluminum plate. In the practice, an optimum mixing ratio that secures a good balance between the photo-adhesion attributed to the addition-reactive functional group (R 18 ) and the water wettability attributed to the partial structure of formula (46) is to be decided through experimentation on varied mixing ratios. Anyway, the mixing ratio is desirably such that the density of the addition-reactive functional groups falls within the above-specified range. More specifically, a suitable mixing molar ratio of the organosilicone compound (45) to the organosilicone compound (40) is 0.05 to 500, preferably 0.2 to 200, still preferably 1 to 100. The water wettability of the non-image areas increases with the amount of the hydrophilic group derived from the compound of formula (45) increasing within this range. Even where the density of the hydrophilic groups is low, it is possible to increase that density by rendering the addition-reactive functional group hydrophilic.  The method of bonding the addition-reactive functional group to the aluminum plate is roughly divided into (i) a method in which the organosilicone compound is used as such (hereinafter referred to as a SC method), which has been described above, and (ii) a method in which the organosilicone compound is hydrolyzed and polycondensed to form an organic/inorganic composite comprising an inorganic polymer containing an -Si-O-Si- bond and having the addition-reactive functional groups fixed to the inorganic polymer (hereinafter referred to as an SG method). On applying the organic/inorganic composite to an aluminum plate and drying, the inorganic polymer portion adheres to the plate while the addition-reactive functional groups remain on the plate surface. Where the SC method is followed, bonding of the addition-reactive functional groups tends to be localized at the sites of the aluminum plate having specific properties, making it difficult to uniformly distribute the functional groups on the support. That is, the silicon atoms are likely to form a covalent bond at specific acidic sites or basic sites, so that the distribution of the addition-reactive functional groups tends to be governed by the distribution of acidic sites or basic sites of the aluminum plate. Such an uneven distribution of the functional groups may cause unevenness in photo-adhesive strength of image areas or water wettability of non-image areas. In cases where such tendency is observed, the  SG method is advantageously followed. Intermediate modes between the SC method and the SG method are also employable. For example, an organosilicone compound composed of two or three molecules of the compound of formula (40): R 18 Si(OR 19 ) 3  with all or a part of the OR 19  groups hydrolyzed can be used. According to the SG method, the organosilicone compound of formula (40), either alone or as a mixture with the organosilicone compound of formula (45) at a certain mixing ratio, is hydrolyzed in liquid in the presence or absence of a catalyst in such a manner that the reaction may not take place at the addition-reactive functional groups R 18  but at the -OR 19  (and -OR 21 ) groups and, at the same time, polycondensed to obtain a liquid composition comprising an inorganic polymer having the center Si atoms linked through an -Si-O-Si- bond. The resulting liquid composition is applied to the aluminum plate, and if necessary dried, to bond the addition-reactive functional groups to the plate. In this case, the distribution of the addition-reactive functional groups fixed onto the aluminum plate is less influenced by the chemical properties of the plate, such as distribution of acidic sites or basic sites. Where the organosilicone compound of formula (45) is used in combination with the organosilicone compound of formula (40) as starting materials, the ratio of the addition-reactive functional  group-bound sites and the hydrophilic group-bound sites on the aluminum support is substantially ruled by the charging ratio of the organosilicone compound (40) to the organosilicone compound (45). This means that the process parameters for obtaining an optimum surface can be designed more orderly than in the SC method. Specific examples of the organosilicone compounds of formula (40) which can be used in the invention are:  CH 2 =CH-Si(OCOCH 3 ) 3 , CH 2 =CH-Si(OC 2 H 5 ) 3 , CH 2 =CH-Si(OCH 3 ) 3 , CH 2 =CHCH 2 -Si(OC 2 H 5 ) 3 , CH 2 =CHCH 2 NH(CH 2 ) 3 -Si(OCH 3 ) 3 , CH 2 =CHCOO-(CH 2 ) 3 -Si(OCH 3 ) 3 , CH 2 =CHCOO-(CH 2 ) 3 -Si(OC 2 H 5 ) 3 , CH 2 =C(CH 3 )COO-(CH 2 ) 3 -Si(OCH 3 ) 3 , CH 2 =C(CH 3 )COO-(CH 2 ) 3 -Si(OC 2 H 5 ) 3 , CH 2 =C(CH 3 )COO-(CH 2 ) 4 -Si(OCH 3 ) 3 , CH 2 =C(CH 3 )COO-(CH 2 ) 5 -Si(OCH 3 ) 3 , CH 2 =CHCOO-(CH 2 ) 4 -Si(OCH 3 ) 3 , (CH 2 =C(CH 3 )COO-(CH 2 ) 3 ) 2 -Si(OCH 3 ) 2 , CH 2 =C(CH=CH 2 )-Si(OCH 3 ) 3 , CH 2 =CH-SO 2 NH-(CH 2 ) 3 -Si(OCH 3 ) 3 , CH 2 =CH-ph-O-Si(OCH 3 ) 3  (ph: benzene ring),  CH 2 =CH-ph-CONH-(CH 2 ) 3 -Si(OCH 3 ) 3 , CH 2 =CH-ph-CH 2 NH-(CH 2 ) 3 -Si(OCH 3 ) 3 , HC\u2261C-Si(OC 2 H 5 ) 3 , CH 3 C\u2261C-Si(OC 2 H 5 )3,  CH 2 =CHCH 2 O-Si(OCH 3 ) 3 , (CH 2 =CHCH 2 O) 4 Si, HO-CH 2 -C\u2261C-Si(OC 2 H 5 ) 3 , CH 3 CH 2 CO-C\u2261C-Si(OC 2 H 5 ) 3 , CH 2 =CHS-(CH 2 ) 3 -Si(OCH 3 ) 3 , CH 2 =CHCH 2 O-(CH 2 ) 2 -SCH 2 -Si(OCH 3 ) 3 , CH 2 =CHCH 2 S-(CH 2 ) 3 -S-Si(OCH 3 ) 3 , (CH 3 ) 3 CCO-C\u2261C-Si(OC 2 H 5 ) 3 , (CH 2 =CH) 2 N-(CH 2 ) 2 SCH 2 -Si(OCH 3 ) 3 , and CH 3 COCH=C(CH 3 )-O-Si(OCH 3 ) 3 . Specific examples of the organosilicone compounds represented by formula (45) are tetramethoxysilane, tetraethoxysilane, tetraisopropoxysilane, tetra(n-propoxy) silane, tetra(n-butoxy) silane, tetrakis(2-ethylbutoxy) silane, tetrakis (2-ethylhexyloxy) silane, tetrakis (2-methoxyethoxy) silane, tetraphenoxysilane, and tetraacetoxysilane, with tetraethoxysilane being preferred. Whether the SC method or the SG method is adopted to bond the addition-reactive functional groups to the aluminum plate, the kind of the solvent, the method of applying to the plate, the drying method, and the like are common, except that the SG method needs previous preparation of the inorganic polymer composition. A preferred embodiment of the SG method will be described below with particular reference to the combined use of the organosilicone compounds of formulae (40) and (45). Alcohols, such as methanol, ethanol, propanol, isopropyl alcohol, ethylene glycol, and hexyleneglycol, are used as a solvent for the hydrolysis and polycondensation of the organosilicone compounds of formulae (40) and (45) into a liquid composition suited to the SG method.  The solvent is usually used in an amount 0.2 to 500 times, preferably 0.5 to 100 times, still preferably 1 to 20 times, the total weight of the organosilicone compounds. If the weight ratio of the solvent is less than 0.2, the reaction system is apt to become gel and instable with time. If it exceeds 500, the reaction takes several days to complete. Water for hydrolysis is added in an amount of 0.1 to 1000 mol, preferably 0.5 to 200 mol, still preferably 1.5 to 100 mol, per mole of the total of the organosilicone compounds. With less than 0.1 mol of water, the hydrolysis and the successive polycondensation are slow, requiring several days to achieve stable surface treatment. With more than 1000 mol of water, on the other hand, the resulting composition not only shows contact failure when applied onto an aluminum surface but exhibits poor stability with time, often turning into gel during coating. The reaction temperature convenient for preparing a suitable composition is usually from room temperature up to about 100\u00b0C. Temperatures out of this range are usable in the presence of some of the catalysts hereinafter described. Temperatures above the boiling point of the solvent used are also adoptable, in which cases a refluxing condenser can be fitted to the reactor if necessary.  Catalysts which can be used according to necessity include acids, such as hydrochloric acid, sulfuric acid, nitric acid, phosphoric acid, acetic acid, malic acid, and oxalic acid; and bases, such as ammonia, tetramethylammonium hydroxide, potassium hydroxide, and sodium hydroxide. The catalyst is used in an amount of 0.001 to 1 mol, preferably 0.002 to 0.7 mol, more preferably 0.003 to 0.4 mol, per mole of the total of the organosilicone compounds (40) and (45). Use of more than 1 mol of the catalyst is no benefit for economy. A convenient reaction temperature in using a weak acid, e.g., acetic acid or malic acid, as a catalyst is 40 to 100\u00b0C, while that in using a strong acid, e.g., sulfuric acid or nitric acid is 10 to 60\u00b0C. In using phosphoric acid, the reaction temperature can range from 10 to 90\u00b0C. Heat application is usually involved in the preparation of the composition used in the SG method and in drying the applied composition. A volatile acid might evaporate by the heat to corrode the peripheral equipment. Therefore, where the SG method is adopted to a system having an iron material, it is recommended to use sulfuric acid and/or phosphoric acid which are nonvolatile as a catalyst. The composition comprising the organosilicone compounds of formulae (40) and (45) , the organic solvent, water and, if desired, the catalyst is allowed to react at a selected  temperature for a selected time while, if necessary, stirring. Whereupon hydrolysis and polycondensation take place to form a polymer or colloidal polymer containing an Si-O-Si bond, and the liquid composition increases the viscosity into sol. When the organosilicone compounds of formulae (40) and (45) are used in combination as described above, both of them may be put into the reactor from the beginning, or either one of them is allowed to undergo hydrolysis and polycondensation to some extent, whereon the other organosilicone compound is added to complete the reaction. The sol composition thus prepared sometimes undergoes further polycondensation reaction into gel while left to stand at room temperature. Such gelation can be prevented or retarded by diluting the composition immediately after preparation with a solvent which is to be used in applying to the aluminum plate. In order to bond a desired amount of the organosilicone compound or the addition-reactive functional group to the aluminum plate and to avoid uneven distribution of the organosilicone compound or the addition-reactive functional group on the support, it is preferable that the concentration of the treating liquid, whether by the SC method or the SG method, be adjusted by addition of a solvent before application. While an alcohol solvent, especially methanol, is suited for the purpose, other solvents, organic compounds, inorganic additives, surface active agents, etc. may be added.  Other solvents that can be added to the treating liquid include methyl ethyl ketone, ethylene glycol monomethyl ether, ethylene glycol monoethyl ether, 2-methoxyethyl acetate, 1-methoxy-2-propyl acetate, dimethoxyethane, methyl lactate, ethyl lactate, acetylacetone, and ethylene glycol. Organic compounds that can be added to the treating liquid include epoxy resins, acrylic resins, butyral resins, urethane resins, novolak resins, pyrogallol-acetone resins, polyvinylpyrrolidone, polyvinyl alcohol, polyvinyl methyl ether, and polypropylene glycol. Useful inorganic additives include colloidal silica and colloidal alumina. High-boiling solvents, such as ethylene glycol and ethylene glycol monomethyl ether, serve to improve the stability of the liquid diluted to the concentration for application to the support and to assure the reactivity reproduction of the bonded addition-reactive functional group. Organic compounds, such as novolak resins and pyrogallol-acetone resins, produce the same effects but have a side action of reducing the water wettability of the support and therefore need strict control on the amount to be added. When the sol or liquid composition suitable for the SG method is applied on the aluminum plate and dried in air or under heat, the inorganic polymer having an Si-O-Si bond turns into gel and forms a covalent bond with the surface of the aluminum  plate. The step of drying, which is for removal of the solvent, residual water and, in some cases, the catalyst, may be omitted for some uses of the resulting support. In the SC method, the step of drying is contemplated for not only removal of the solvent, residual water, etc. but securing the adhesion between the organosilicone compound and the aluminum plate. Accordingly, for some purposes, heat application may be continued after completion of drying. The maximum temperature in the drying step or in the continued heating is preferably such that the addition-reactive functional group R 18  may not decompose. From this viewpoint a useful drying or heating temperature ranges from room temperature to 200\u00b0C, preferably up to 150\u00b0C, particularly up to 120\u00b0C. The drying time is usually 1 second to 30 minutes, preferably 5 seconds to 10 minutes, still preferably 10 seconds to 3 minutes. The treating liquid (the organosilicone compounds  per se  or a solution or a sol solution thereof) is applied by various known coating techniques, such as brush coating, dip coating, atomizing, spin coating, doctor blade coating, and the like. A suitable coating technique is chosen taking into consideration the surface shape of the aluminum plate, a contemplated film thickness, and so forth.  The surface treatments such as graining and anodizing which are given to the aluminum plate before the above-described silicate treatment will be explained below in detail. (Graining treatment) Graining can be carried out by mechanical graining, chemical graining, electrolytic graining (electrochemical graining in a hydrochloric acid or nitric acid electrolytic solution), or a like technique as taught in JP-A-56-28893. Mechanical graining includes wire brush graining (scratching with a metal wire brush), ball graining with abrasive balls and an abrasive agent, brush graining with a nylon brush and an abrasive agent. Two or more of these graining methods can be used in combination. In particular, electrochemical graining in a hydrochloric acid or nitric acid electrolytic solution is suitable for making surface roughness useful in the present invention. Electrolysis is preferably carried out in a 0.1 to 50% solution of hydrochloric acid or nitric acid at 20 to 100\u00b0C for 1 second to 30 minutes at a current density of 100 to 400 C/dm 2 . The grained aluminum plate is chemically etched with an acid or an alkali. An alkali etchant (i.e., etching agent) is preferred in industrial application of the invention; for acid etchant needs time to destroy the microstructure. Suitable alkali etchant includes 1 to 50% aqueous solutions of  sodium hydroxide, sodium carbonate, sodium aluminate, sodium metasilicate, sodium phosphate, potassium hydroxide, lithium hydroxide, etc. The alkali etchant is used at 20 to 100\u00b0C. The concentration and the temperature conditions are preferably selected so as to dissolve 5 to 20 g of aluminum per m 3 . The chemical etching is followed by desmutting by washing with an acid, such as nitric acid, sulfuric acid, phosphoric acid, chromic acid, hydrofluoric acid, and tetrafluoroboric acid. The method disclosed in JP-A-53-12739 which comprises treating with 15 to 65 wt% sulfuric acid at 50 to 90\u00b0C or the alkali etching method disclosed in JP-B-48-28123 are preferred particularly for desmutting following the electrochemical surface graining. (Anodization) The aluminum plate thus treated is preferably subjected to anodizing. Anodizing can be performed by a method conventionally employed in the art. Specifically, a direct current or an alternating current is applied to the aluminum plate in an aqueous or non-aqueous solution of at least one of sulfuric acid, phosphoric acid, chromic acid, oxalic acid, sulfamic acid, benzenesulfonic acid, etc. thereby to form an anodized layer on the aluminum plate. The anodizing conditions are subject to variation depending on the electrolytic solution used. Generally suitable conditions are 1 to 80% in electrolytic solution  concentration; 5 to 70\u00b0C in solution temperature; 0.5 to 60 A/dm 2  in current density; 1 to 100 V in voltage; and 10 to 100 seconds in electrolysis time. In particular, anodizing is preferably carried out in accordance with the method disclosed in British Patent 1,412,768 which uses sulfuric acid and a high current density and the method described in U.S. Patent 3,511,661 which uses phosphoric acid. The anodized layer preferably has a thickness corresponding to 1 to 10 g/m 2 . A smaller thickness tends to allow the printing plate to receive scratches easily. A larger thickness requires much power to form, which is economically disadvantageous. A preferred thickness is 1.5 to 7 g/m 2 , particularly 2 to 5 g/m 2 . The graining treatment and/or the anodizing treatment can be followed by sealing treatment. Sealing treatment is carried out by immersion in a hot water bath which may contain an inorganic salt or an organic salt or by exposure in a steam bath. The thus treated aluminum plate is subjected to the silicate treatment, acid treatment, and adhesive layer formation as described hereinabove to complete an aluminum support. The aluminum support is coated with the photopolymerizable photosensitive layer to obtain a lithographic printing plate precursor according to this invention. If desired, an organic undercoat may be provided  between the support and the photosensitive layer. An undercoat comprising a water-soluble resin, such as polyvinylphosphonic acid, a polymer or copolymer having a sulfonic acid group in the side chain, polyacrylic acid or a water-soluble metal salt (e.g., zinc borate) , a yellow dye, an amine salt, etc. is also suitable. Organic compounds which can be used as an organic undercoat include carboxymethyl,cellulose, dextrin, gum arabic, organic phosphonic acids, such as those having an amino group (e.g., 2-aminoethylphosphonic acid), phenylphosphonic acid, a substituted phenylphosphonic acid, naphthylphosphonic acid, an alkylphosphonic acid, glycerophosphonic acid, methylenediphosphonic acid, and ethylenediphosphonic acid; organic phosphoric acids, such as phenylphosphoric acid, a substituted phenylphosphoric acid, naphthylphosphoric acid, an alkylphosphoric acid, and glycerophosphoric acid; organic phosphinic acids, such as phenylphosphinic acid, a substituted phenylphosphinic acid, naphthylphosphinic acid, an alkylphosphinic acid, and glycerophosphinic acid; amino acids, such as glycine and \u03b2-alanine; and amine hydrochlorides having a hydroxyl group, such as triethanolamine hydrochloride. These organic compounds can be used either individually or as a mixture of two or more thereof.  The organic undercoat can be formed by (i) a method in which a solution of the organic compound in water or an organic solvent (e.g., methanol, ethanol, methyl ethyl ketone or a mixture thereof) is applied to the aluminum support and dried or (ii) a method in which the aluminum support is dipped in the above-described organic compound solution, washed with water, etc., and dried. The organic compound solution used in the former method has a concentration of 0.005 to 10% by weight. The solution can be applied by bar coater coating, spin coating, spray coating, curtain coating, or a like coating method. The organic compound solution used in the latter method has a concentration of 0.01 to 20% by weight, preferably 0.05 to 5% by weight, and a temperature of 20 to 90\u00b0C, preferably 25 to 50\u00b0C. The dipping time is 0.1 second to 20 minutes, preferably 2 seconds to 1 minute. The pH of the organic compound solution can be adjusted within a range of 1 to 12 by addition of a basic substance, e.g., ammonia, triethylamine or potassium hydroxide, or an acidic substance, e.g., hydrochloric acid or phosphoric acid. The organic compound solution can contain a yellow dye for the purpose of improving tone reproducibility. The organic compound solution is suitably applied to a dry thickness (in terms of dry coating weight) of 2 to 200 mg/m 2 , preferably 5 to 100 mg/m 2 . A coating thickness less than 2 mg/m 2  or more than 200 mg/m 2  may fail to assure a sufficient  press life. If desired, additional surface treatments, such as dipping in an aqueous solution of potassium fluorozirconate, a phosphate, etc., can be added to the aluminum plate in the course of preparation of the aluminum support. (Protective layer for oxygen barrier) Since the lithographic printing plate precursor is usually exposed to light in the air, it is desirable to provide a protective layer for oxygen barrier on the photopolymerizable photosensitive layer. An oxygen-barrier protective layer serves to prevent low-molecular compounds such as oxygen and basic substances present in the air, which interferes with the image formation reaction of the photosensitive layer caused by exposure, from entering the photosensitive layer, thereby permitting exposure in the air. Therefore, the characteristic required of such a protective layer is low permeability to low-molecular compounds such as oxygen. It is additionally desirable for the protective layer to cause no substantial hindrance to transmission of light for exposure, to have high adhesion to the photosensitive layer, and to be easily removable in the step of development which follows exposure.  The oxygen-barrier protective layer preferably comprises water-soluble vinyl polymers. Useful water-soluble vinyl polymers include polyvinyl alcohol, a partial ester, ether or acetal of polyvinyl alcohol, and copolymers thereof comprising an unsubstituted vinyl alcohol unit in such an amount enough to make the whole copolymers water-soluble to a required degree. Useful polyvinyl alcohol includes one having a degree of hydrolysis of 71 to 100% and a degree of polymerization of 300 to 2400. Such polyvinyl alcohol species are available in the market under trade names of PVA-105, PVA-110, PVA-117, PVA-117H, PVA-120, PVA-124, PVA-124H, PVA-CS, PVA-CST, PVA-HC, PVA-203, PVA-204, PVA-205, PVA-210, PVA-217, PVA-220, PVA-224, PVA-217EE, PVA-220, PVA-224, PVA-217EE, PVA-217E, PVA-220E, PVA-224E, PVA-405, PVA-420, PVA-613, and L-8, all supplied by Kuraray Co., Ltd. The copolymers referred to above include polyvinyl acetate chloroacetate or propionate having a degree of hydrolysis of 88 to 100%, polyvinyl formal, polyvinyl acetal, and copolymers thereof. In addition, polyvinylpyrrolidone, gelatin, gum arabic, etc. are useful polymers. These compounds can be used either individually or as a combination thereof. The compounds for forming the oxygen-barrier protective layer are applied as dissolved in a solvent, such as pure water, alcohols (e.g., methanol and ethanol), ketones (e.g., acetone and methyl ethyl ketone), a mixed solvent of pure  water and the ketone. A suitable solids content of the solution is 1 to 20% by weight. The coating solution can further contain known additives, such as surface active agents for improving coating properties and water-soluble plasticizers for improving the physical properties of the protective layer. Useful water-soluble plasticizers include propionamide, cyclohexanediol, glycerol, and sorbitol. Water-soluble (meth) acrylic polymers can be added to the coating solution. The coating solution for the protective layer is applied suitably to a dry thickness of about 0.1 to 15 mg/m 2 , preferably about 1.0 to 5.0 mg/m 2 . The lithographic printing plate precursor of the present invention is imagewise exposed to light for direct writing by use of the second harmonic of an Ar laser or a semiconductor laser (SHG-LD; 350 to 600 nm), a YAG-SHG laser, an He-Ne laser (633, 543 or 364 nm), an Ar laser (515 or 488 nm), an FD-YAG laser (532 nm), an InGaN semiconductor laser (360 to 450 nm, especially 405 nm) and subjected to development processing. Conventional alkali aqueous solutions can be used as a developer. Alkalis generally employed include inorganic ones, such as sodium silicate, potassium silicate, sodium tertiary phosphate, potassium tertiary phosphate, ammonium tertiary phosphate, sodium secondary phosphate, potassium  secondary phosphate, ammonium secondary phosphate, sodium carbonate, potassium carbonate, ammonium carbonate, sodium hydrogencarbonate, potassium hydxogencarbonate, ammonium hydrogencarbonate, sodium borate, potassium borate, ammonium borate, sodium hydroxide, potassium hydroxide, ammonium hydroxide, and lithium hydroxide; and organic ones, such as monomethylamine, dimethylamine, trimethylamine, monoethylamine, diethylamine, triethylamine, monoisopropylamine, diisopropylamine, triisopropylamine, n-butylamine, monoethanolamine, diethanolamine triethnanolamine, monoisopropanolamine, diisopropanolamine, ethyleneimine, ethylenediamine, and pyridine. These alkalis can be used either individually or as a combination of two or more thereof. Among aqueous solutions of the above alkalis, an aqueous solution of an alkali metal silicate having a pH of 12 or higher particularly allows the effects of the invention be manifested. The developing properties of an alkali metal silicate aqueous solution are controllable by the ratio of the silicon oxide (SiO 2 ) of the silicate to the alkali metal oxide (M 2 O), generally represented in terms of SiO 2 /M 2 O molar ratio, and the concentration. From this point of view, it is preferable to use a sodium silicate aqueous solution having an SiO 2 /Na 2 O molar ratio of 1.0 to 1.5 and an SiO 2  content of 1 to 4% by weight, which is disclosed in JP-A-54-62004; or an alkali  metal silicate aqueous solution having an SiO 2 /M molar ratio of 0.5 to 0.75 (i.e., SiO 2 /M 2 O=1.0 to 1.5) and an SiO 2  content of 1 to 4% by weight and containing potassium in an amount of at least 20% based on the total gram atom of the alkali metals present in the developer, which is proposed in JP-B-57-7427. Where development is conducted by use of an automatic developing machine, it is known that developing processing could be continued for an prolonged period of time to treat a larger number of lithographic printing plate precursors without exchanging the developer of a developing tank by replenishing the tank with a replenisher having a higher alkali strength than the running developer. This manipulation is also effective in processing the printing plate precursor of the present invention. For example, in case of using the above-described developer of JP-A-54-62004, a developing tank is replenished with a sodium silicate agueous solution having an SiO 2 /Na 2 O molar ratio of 0.5 to 1.5. In case of using the developer of JP-B-57-7427, a developing tank is replenished with an alkali metal silicate aqueous solution having an SiO 2 /M molar ratio of 0.25 to 0.75 (i.e., SiO 2 /M 2 O=0.5 to 1.5), and both the running developer and the replenisher contain potassium in an amount of 20% based on the respective total alkali metal content in terms of gram atom.  The resulting lithographic printing plate can be subjected to post treatments, i.e., washing with water, rinsing with a rinsing solution containing a surface active agent, etc., and a desensitizing solution containing gum arabic, a starch derivative, etc., as described in JP-A-54-54-8002, JP-A-55-115045 and JP-A-59-58431. These post treatments can be performed in various combinations. The lithographic printing plate is mounted on an offset printing machine for large-volume printing. The printing plate can be cleaned with a conventional plate cleaner, such as CL-1, CL-2, CP, CN4, CN, CG-1, PC-1, SR and IC (all supplied by Fuji Photo Film Co., Ltd.).

Unless otherwise noted, all the percents are by weight. SYNTHESIS EXAMPLE 1 Synthesis of polyurethane resin 5: In a 500 ml three-necked round flask equipped with a condenser and a stirrer, 11.1 g (0.075 mol) of 2,2-bis(hydroxymethyl)butanoic acid and 25.0 g (0.025 mol) of propylene glycol having an average molecular weight of 1,000 were dissolved in 100 ml of N,N-dimethylacetamide. To the solution were added 20.5 g (0.082 mol) of 4,4'-diphenylmethane diisocyanate and 8.3 g (0.021 mol) of diisocyanate compound (2). The mixture was stirred at 100\u00b0C for 5 hours and then diluted with 200 ml of N,N-dimethylformamide and 400 ml of methanol. The reaction solution was poured into 4 liters of water while stirring to precipitate a white polymer, which was collected by filtration, washed with water, and dried in vacuum to obtain 50 g of the polymer. The resulting polymer had a weight average molecular weight of 78,000 as measured by gel-permeation chromatography (GPC) on a polystyrene standard (hereinafter the same). The carboxyl content (acid value) of the polymer was  found by titration to be 1.33 meq/g. SYNTHESIS EXAMPLE 2 Synthesis of polyurethane resin 36: In 100 ml of N,N-dimethylacetamide were dissolved 11.1 g (0.075 mol) of 2,2-bis(hydxoxymethyl)butanoic acid and 25.0 g (0.025 mol) of polypropylene glycol having an average molecular weight of 1,000. To the solution were added 20.5 g (0.082 mol) of 4,4'-diphenylmethane diisocyanate and 10.6 g (0. 021 mol) of diisocyanate compound (41), and the mixture was allowed to react and post-processed in the same manner as in Synthesis Example 1 to give 60 g of a polymer, which was found to have a weight average molecular weight of 78,000 by GPC and a carboxyl content (acid value) of 1.33 meq/g by titration. Polyurethane resins were synthesized in the same manner as in Synthesis Examples 1 and 2, except for using the diisocyanate compound and the diol compound shown in Table 3. The weight average molecular weight (Mw) and the acid value of the resulting resins are also shown in Table 3.  EXAMPLES 1 TO 11 AND COMPARATIVE EXAMPLES 1 TO 3 Preparation of aluminum support: A 0.30 mm thick aluminum plate made of aluminum 1S was grained with a nylon brush (No. 8) and an aqueous suspension of purmice stone (800 mesh). After thorough washing with water, the plate was immersed in a 10% sodium hydroxide aqueous solution at 70\u00b0C for 60 seconds, followed by washing with running water. The plate was washed with 20% nitric acid for neutralization, followed by washing with water. The plate was grained by electrolysis in a 1% nitric acid aqueous solution using a sinusoidal alternating current at a voltage V A  of 12.7 V and an anodic electricity quantity of 300 Coulomb/dm 2 . The resulting plate had a center-line average roughness (Ra) of 0.45 \u00b5m. The plate was immersed in a 30% sulfuric acid aqueous solution at 55\u00b0C for 2 minutes for desmutting. Then the plate was anodized in a 20% sulfuric acid aqueous solution at 33\u00b0C for 50 seconds at a current density of 5 A/dm 2  with a cathode disposed on the side of the grained surface. The formed anodized layer had a thickness of 2.7 g/m 2 . Formation of undercoat: A coating composition for an undercoat was prepared by mixing the following components in a beaker by stirring at 25\u00b0C for 20 minutes.  Si(OC 2 H 5 ) 4 38 g 3-Methacryloxypropyltrimethoxysilane 13 g 85% Phosphoric acid aqueous solution 12 g Ion-exchanged water 15 g Methanol 100 g The resulting solution was transferred to a three-necked flask equipped with a refluxing condenser. The flask was put into an oil bath at room temperature, and the contents were heated up to 50\u00b0C over 30 minutes while stirring with a magnetic stirrer and further allowed to react for 1 hour while keeping the bath temperature at 50\u00b0C to prepare a coating composition. The composition was diluted to 0.5% with methanol/ethylene glycol (20/1 by weight) and applied to the aluminum support by wheeler coating and dried at 100\u00b0C for 1 minute. The coating weight in terms of Si as measured by X-ray fluorescence analysis was 3.0 mg/m 2 . Formation of photosensitive layer: A photopolymerizable composition having the following formulation was applied to the aluminum support to a dry coating weight of 1.5 g/m 2  and dried at 120\u00b0C for 1 minute to form a photosensitive layer.

Composition of oxygen-barrier layer: Kuraray Poval PVA-105 (polyvinyl alcohol having a degree of saponification of 98 mol% and a degree of polymerization of 500, available from Kuraray Co., Ltd.) 95% Polyvinylpyrrolidone K30 (available from Wako Pure Chemical Ind., Ltd.) 5% Preparation of lithographic printing plate and evaluation: The printing plate precursor thus obtained was imagewise exposed to light by use of a plate setter CELIC 8200 CTP (Ar laser (488 nm), supplied by Fuji Photo Film Co., Ltd.) at an output of 0.2 mJ/cm 2  as focused on the plate surface to give a dot image having a dot percent varying from 1 to 99% at aline density of 175 lines per inch and a dot density of 2540 dpi. The exposed plate was developed on an automatic developing machine LP850P-II (supplied by Fuji Photo Film Co., Ltd.) with a developer (LP-D, available from Fuji Photo Film, 9-fold diluted with water and adjusted to a pH of 12.8, used at a liquid  temperature of 25\u00b0C) and a finisher (FP-2W gum solution, available from Fuji Photo Film, 3-fold diluted with water) to produce a lithographic printing plate. The printing plate was mounted on a four-color printing machine MOV, manufactured by Heilderberger Druckmaschien AG, and printing was carried out to obtain 120,000 prints using an ink Craph G(N) available from Dainippon Ink & Chemicals. The press life of the printing plate was evaluated from the number of prints which reproduced 2% dots in 175 lines/inch. The results obtained are shown in Table 4.

The lithographic printing plate precursor according to the invention, of which the photopolymerizable photosensitive layer contains, as a binder, a polyurethane having at least one ethylenically unsaturated polymerizable group in the side chain thereof, exhibits high sensitivity and provides a lithographic printing plate with an excellent press life and stain resistance, particularly excellent highlight characteristics. While the invention has been described in detail and with reference to specific embodiments thereof, it will be apparent to one skilled in the art that various changes and modification can be made therein without departing from the spirit and scope thereof.", "tags": ["G03F"]}
