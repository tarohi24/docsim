DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS Reference will now be made, in detail, to a preferred embodiment of the present invention, an example of which is illustrated in the accompanying drawings and is represented generally by the numeral 15. Whenever possible, the same reference numbers will be used throughout the drawings to refer to the same or like parts. Referring now to FIG. 3(A) and in accordance with the present invention, a golf glove is provided with a design having, in the order of from left to right, back sections of the ring finger 2, middle finger 3 and index finger 4 on which a groove 4" runs lengthwise, and when the trank 19 is folded along the center line between the front and back sections of the index finger 4, 4', these back sections complement the front sections of the index finger 4', middle finger 3' ring finger 2', and the front and back sections of the little finger 1, 1' are provided at the end. The glove is closed by stitching the back section 4 and the front section 4' with a fourchette 6 attached along the brims 5, 5'. The middle finger is closed by stitching the front and back sections 3,3' with a fourchette 6' being set in along the brims 7,7'; 7", 7'". The ring finger is closed by stitching the front and back sections 2, 2' along the brims 8, 8', 8", 8'" with a fourchette 6" being set in. The little finger is completed by stitching the front and back sections 1, 1" with a fourchette being set in along the brims 9, 9'. Each of the fingers is closed by stitching the fourchettes 6, 6', 6", 6'" being set in the front sections 1, 1', 1", 1'" of each finger from the outside so that brims 10, 10', 10", 10'" are exposed to the outside. Conversely, the back sections of each finger are closed by stitching the fourchettes 6, 6', 6", 6'" being set in to the back sections 1, 2, 3, 4 of each finger from the inside by flipping over the trank so that the brims 11, 11', 11", 11'" are not exposed to the outside. Another feature of the present invention is to provide a groove 20 on the back sections of the thumb 17 and index finger 4. Each groove 20 is covered from the inside of the thumb 17 and index finger 4 with a piece of man-made fabric known as spandex 20 by sewing around the grooves 4", 17'. The trank 19 is closed by first sewing the left bream 12 and right bream 12' from the inside and then flipping the trank over and round up with the seam 13. Another example of the present invention is illustrated in FIG. 3 wherein the trank is cut so that the back section of the ring finger 2 complements the back section of the little finger 1 and closes the trank according to the method already outlined so as to form a seam 14 as shown in FIG. 4. The fourchettes 6, 6', 6", 6'" are cut according to the size and shape corresponding to each finger and folded in one half. The unexplained reference numeral 18 is a magnetic tape. The preferred embodiment of the present invention is to provide one of the seams 13, 14 on the back section of a left hand glove so as to eliminate a seam on the side of the little finger from which unpleasant pressure is produced and by providing a groove on each of the back sections of the thumb and index finger which is covered from the inside with a piece of man-made fabric known as spandex by sewing around the grooves so as to provide the wearer comfort as well as to prevent the twisting of the fourchettes when golf is being played and to restore the glove to its original shape when it is taken off. The feature of the present invention lies in the formation of a seam 13, 14 on the back sections of a glove instead of having it on the side of the little fingers so as to relieve pressure and prevent possible tear. As the size of the trank is made smaller it will contribute to the saving of the glove materials, less hours required for stitching, and a lowering of production costs. It will be apparent to those skilled in the art that various modifications and variations can be made in the golf glove of the present invention without departing from the scope or spirit of the present invention. Thus, it is intended that the present invention cover the modifications and variations of this invention provided they come within the scope of the appended claims and their equivalents.
