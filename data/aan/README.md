AAD Dataset
========

Files which should be in this directoty are

- `orig/citations.txt` lists citations within the dataset. In the original dataset, it exists as `aan/release/2014/acl.txt`.
- `orig/collection` stores original txt files.

## Note

After migrations from the original dataset, run `lib/format_rels.py` so that it outputs the `.qrels` file.
